            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Offer unto your Honours the firſt and greateſt task (though the meaneſt work) that hath been yet undertaken; which
<pb facs="tcp:123664:3"/> is, to make the right and power of private Churches conſiſtent and ſociable with the Magiſtrates power over them, &amp; ſo to ſever by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine right the ſacred functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Miniſtery from that of Magiſtracy, as to make both their juriſdictions but one, and derive it from the ſoveraign power of the State, and this from the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who hath given unto the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ſoveraign power and
<pb facs="tcp:123664:3"/> authority for a ſoveraign end; even to ſet up and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the intereſt of his Kingdom. It is one of the moſt dangerous hereſies that ever the wicked one did ſow among his tares, <hi>that the Magiſtrate, though Chriſtian and godly, doth not intend</hi> ex natura rei, <hi>and in regard of his particular voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the glory of Ieſus Chriſt, as Mediatour and King of his Church, and that the end of Magiſtracy is not godlineſs
<pb facs="tcp:123664:4"/> and honesty, but peace and quietneſſe.</hi> For theſe be the words of Mr. Gilleſpie in his Aarons Rod pag. 187. and 188. much like thoſe pag. 253. where he ſaith, <hi>that in a well-conſtituted Church, the Magiſtrate ought not to receive complaints ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited againſt a ſentence of an Eccleſiaſticall Court by the party cenſured:</hi> which lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage I humbly conceive to be rank Popery; for this hereſy (if I may call it ſo,
<pb facs="tcp:123664:4"/> becauſe it is the main engine to ſubvert the doctrine) hath been, and is ſtill, the greateſt dividing principle that the world hath ever had: it diſunites mens minds and affections; it divides, moſt abſurdly, juriſdictions into ſpirituall &amp; temporall, lawes into eccleſiaſticall and civil; it builds up a magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy within the dominions of magiſtrates, independent from them. Theſe erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous tenets I maintain in
<pb facs="tcp:123664:5"/> this Book to have ſet up Popery, and to be the grand myſtery of iniquity; and not their broaching of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred hereſies, which were but conſequences and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts of that great myſtery, and which are very compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible &amp; conſiſtent with the main drift &amp; deſigne of that myſtery; even to ſet up a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction &amp; a government on earth diſtinct from that of the Magiſtrate: whereas the reformation from Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb facs="tcp:123664:5"/> which England of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions hath been moſt bleſſed with, is altogether inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the retaining of that ſpring-head of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Iniquity, by which powers &amp; juriſdictions are divided, and you the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates are removed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from your princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall duty of magiſtracy; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is not ſo much to procure out ward &amp; temporall peace, as eternal happineſs, &amp; to make Acts of Parliament, Statutes,
<pb facs="tcp:123664:6"/> Lawes, Courts, Armies, Navies, Taxes, Exciſe, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, puniſhment of evil doers, ſubſervient to that end. Which duty I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive to be ſo much the more incumbent on you, by how much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the power is that God hath put into your hands. This being an undeniable truth, that, where God hath given more power, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and opportunity to do good, there alſo he hath laid
<pb facs="tcp:123664:6"/> more obligation and duty. For I dare confidently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that all the godly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs and miniſters that ever were in England, put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were they ſo many Bradfords, Latimers, Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams, had not ſo much obligation laid upon them to promote the intereſt of Ieſus Chriſt, in ſetting up his ordinances, as one ſingle woman, Queen Elizabeth, had upon her. So then, right Honourable, I have two
<pb facs="tcp:123664:7"/> main tasks upon my hands. One, to root out that divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding principle and remain of Popery amongſt us, and to prove that there is no other eccleſiaſticall juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but that which the ſpirit of God in the word, by the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, hath over the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men; when it convinceth and perſwadeth them, and brings every thought &amp; affection captive unto the obedience of the
<pb facs="tcp:123664:7"/> croſſe of Chriſt. The other task is, to make your power and duty of magiſtracy in matters of religion ſociable with the right libertie, yea independency of churches. For the magiſtrates are to ſet up pure ordinances, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, Schools of learning; to call Synods, and invite all men to join with them in promoting the intereſt of Ieſus Chriſt: but they are not to conſtrain any mans freedom, liberty, &amp; choice,
<pb facs="tcp:123664:8"/> drawing him to Church perforce, and urging him to embrace rather this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance then that. For as they cannot command grace, ſo they cannot puniſh any man for want of grace, or for an errour in judgement: yet they may puniſh for an errour in practiſe, if it be a breach of the law of the land: they ought alſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain men from ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blaſphemies and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, laying that tye upon
<pb facs="tcp:123664:8"/> them which the Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian Code, <hi>l. omnis de haeret.</hi> impoſeth, <hi>ut ſibi tantum noci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura ſentiant, aliis obfutura non pandant,</hi> to keep thoſe hurtfull tenets to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, not to vent them abroad to the infecting of others. All theſe notions &amp; poſitions I am confident I can make out ſo plain, that they ſhall be obvious to any ordinary underſtanding; ſtraining neither Scripture nor reaſon; nor caſting the
<pb facs="tcp:123664:9"/> miſt of grammaticall and ſcholaſticall learning, to keep men off from ſeeing their way, &amp; diſcerning the truth; nor loading the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent with quotations, which draw the minde beſide the context. May it pleaſe you to pardon this bold addreſs, and uncouth dreſſe and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of a ſtranger, (and yet no longer a ſtranger, being by your bounty na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalized, and made an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh-man) who in affection
<pb facs="tcp:123664:9"/> and zeal to promote the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, peace, and wealth of theſe three Nations, under the protection of his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and to that end to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow his labour &amp; ſtudies, yea his life, will not ſhew himſelf inferiour to any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. I ſhall dye with much comfort, if in my life-time I can ſee ſome fruit of my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; as I doubt not but I ſhall; conjecturing it by the effects that my other labours in this kind have already
<pb facs="tcp:123664:10"/> wrought upon mens minds beyond ſeas, poſſeſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with prejudices, both againſt this ſubject, and the godly party of this Nation. If your Honours apprehend this to be a truth, I humbly conceive that Gods work, which is alſo your work, in ſettling religion, is half done to your hands. For all juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction now ſtreaming from one juriſdiction, even from that of the Soveraign Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate; that religion cannot
<pb facs="tcp:123664:10"/> chuſe but be well ſettled, which retaining ſoundneſſe in doctrine, and holineſſe in life, is harboured under ſuch a church-government, as hath no claſhing with that of the Magiſtrate. Such, as I humbly conceive, may be eſtabliſhed by ſetting up Overſeers and <hi>Biſhops</hi> over Miniſters and Churches; with whom if the right of private Churches can but ſtand, &amp; be kept inviolable, (as no doubt but it may)
<pb facs="tcp:123664:11"/> no government can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined more preſerving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in doctrine and diſcipline, &amp; beſides baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all juriſdiction which ſteps between magiſtracy &amp; the inward juriſdiction of the ſpirit of God in the word, over mens minds &amp; hearts; and thereby making all the church-judicatory power more naturally flowing from, and depending upon the Magiſtrate, and eaſing him, by this compendious
<pb facs="tcp:123664:11"/> way of inſpection, by a few good mens eyes, who may have a particular overſight of the affairs of the Church. And thus by ſuch a tempered government, the four par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, namely the Epiſcopall, the Eraſtian, the brethren of the Presbytery, and of the Congregationall way, will have a ground for reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, &amp; obtain, with ſome condeſcenſion, what every one of them deſireth. The Lord make you his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

               <item>
                  <label>Chap. I.</label> OF the nature of power &amp; authority. That there are but two ways to bring men to yield obedience; either by a coactive power, or by perſwading them by advice and counſell. That there is no medium betwixt command and counſell: which ſheweth that Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction is a name without a thing, not being exerciſed by either of them. The diviſion of power, and of the ſubordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and coordination of powers. Many errours and mistakes are diſcovered about ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and coordination of powers. That the power called Eccleſiaſticall doth ſignifie nothing; and ſuch as it is, is ſubordinate to that of the Magiſtrate. <hi>Fol.</hi> 1</item>
               <item>
                  <label>Chap. II.</label> Of the nature and diviſion of right divine and humane. In vain do they call things of divine poſitive right, which are acted by a naturall right: ſuch are many church acts. Things that are of divine right may be ſaid to be of humane right, and on the contrary, thoſe things that are of humane right may be ſaid to be of divine right: which is an argument that, by right, power cannot be divided betwixt clergy and laity. 25</item>

               <item>
                  <label>Chap. III.</label> The nature, matter, form, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of law. The canons and ſentences of Church-judicatories have no force of law, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they receive it from the ſanction of the magistrate. The defects in the diviſion of laws into Divine and humane; into morall, ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall and politick; and into Eccleſiaſticall and civil. 34</item>
               <item>
                  <label>Chap. IV.</label> Of the nature of judgement what judgement every private man hath, what the magiſtrate, and what miniſters, ſynods and church-judicatories. They have no definitive judgement, as Mr. Rutherfurd aſſerts; but the magiſtrate hath the greateſt ſhare in definitive judgements; which is proved by ſome paſſages of Mr. Rutherfurd, and of Pareus and Rivetus. Who is the judge of controverſies? 44</item>
               <item>
                  <label>Chap. V.</label> An examination of the 30. chapter of the confeſſion of faith made by the Rever. Aſſembly of Divines. That in their Aſſembly they aſſumed no juriſdiction, nor had any dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               <item>
                  <label>Chap. VI.</label> Whether Ieſus Chriſt hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a juriſdiction called eccleſiaſticall, as King and head of his Church. Of the nature of the Kingdom of God. In what ſenſe the magiſtrate is head of the Church. 65</item>

               <item>
                  <label>Chap. VIII.</label> Mr. Gilleſpies manifeſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions in ſtating the magiſtrates power in matters of Religion. 83</item>
               <item>
                  <label>Chap. IX.</label> The conceſſions of Mr. Gilleſpie, which come to nothing by the multitude of his evaſions and diſtinctions. The vanity and nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his and other mens diviſions and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of power. Martyr, Muſculus, Gualterus alledged againſt the naming of a power eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall, when it is in truth the magistrates power. The poſitions of Maccovius, about the power of the magiſtrate in ſacred things, not hitherto anſwered by any. 91</item>
               <item>
                  <label>Chap. X.</label> Whether the Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath appointed, as the Rever. Aſſembly ſaith, officers in government distinct from the magiſtrate. The ſtrength of the place 2 Chron. 19. by them alledged, examined: That the elders in that place are not church-officers. An anſwer to Mr. Gilleſpies arguments, endeavouring to prove that Ioſaphat appointed two courts, one eccleſiaſticall, another civil. 108</item>
               <item>
                  <label>Chap. XI.</label> A caſe propounded by Mr. Ceſar Calandrin, which he conceiveth to aſſert a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble juriſdiction, examined. Of the two courts; one of magiſtracy or externall, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of conſcience or internall. That eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
<pb facs="tcp:123664:16"/> juriſdiction muſt belong to one of them, or to none. 119</item>
               <item>
                  <label>Chap. XII.</label> Of the nature of calling to the ministery. Miniſters are not called by men, but by God, by a ſucceſſion not of ordination, but providence. The plea for ſucceſſion is Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh. Ministers are no ſucceſſours in their miniſtery to the Iudaicall Prieſts, but to the Prophets. 133</item>
               <item>
                  <label>Chap. XIII.</label> The nature of the miniſters power, and of that of binding and looſing: the power of the keyes. Amyraldus and Mr. Lightfoots ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious expoſition of the power of binding and looſing. The power of governing and ruling is not the eccleſiaſticall contended for. Mr. Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſpies arguments anſwered. 142</item>
               <item>
                  <label>Chap. XIV.</label> That the power of the keyes and of binding and looſing are not committed to all church-officers, but to the miniſters of the Goſpell only. 155</item>
               <item>
                  <label>Chap. XV.</label> That God hath not given to the church-officers of the Goſpell a certain plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of government, and that it is arbitrary and of humane inſtitution, and therefore not to be administred by a power diſtinct from the humane. 161</item>
               <item>
                  <label>Chap. XVI.</label> The 31. chapter of the confeſſion made by the Rever. Aſſembly examined. The uſe of ſynods. Two things are humbly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented: firſt, that for a re-union of juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions over all perſons and in all cauſes, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
<pb facs="tcp:123664:16"/> made up of miniſters only be re-esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed during the ſitting of Parliament: the ſecond is, that ministers may be put into the ſame capacity as all other ranks of free-born people, to ſit and vote in Parliaments. Of the power of ſynods, and that of the magiſtrate in calling of them. The ſynod of the Apoſtles was extraordinary, not exemplary. The exception of the brethren of Scotland againſt the 2. arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the 31. chapter of the confeſſion examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The uſes and abuſes of ſynods: that they are not the way to compoſe differences in matters of religion, if their canons are beyond counſells and advices. 166</item>
               <item>
                  <label>Chap. XVII.</label> That the Iewiſh Church-officers had not a juriſdiction diſtinct from that of the magiſtrate. Mr. Gilleſpies diſtinction, that they were not materially but formally distinct, examined. The argument of Amyraldus, that though they had a diſtinct juriſdiction, yet the example of the church of the Iewes is no pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern to the Chriſtian church, diſcuſſed, and proved to be of no validity. 192</item>
               <item>
                  <label>Chap. XVIII.</label> The cauſe of miſtakes in ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the nature of the church, and calling that the true church which is not. Three acceptions of the word <hi>Church</hi> in holy writ. The meaning of the word <hi>Church</hi> Matth. 18. v. 17. 206</item>
               <item>
                  <label>Chap. XIX.</label> That a particular aſſembly of Christians meeting in one place about the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, is the only true viſible church
<pb facs="tcp:123664:17"/> mentioned in Scripture. That that church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as an aſſembly of Chriſtians, bringeth forth other kinds of acts then it doth conſidered as a ſociety of men: by which the nature and extent of the power of a private church is made clear and evident. 213</item>
               <item>
                  <label>Chap. XX.</label> That the power attributed to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate churches by the reverend diſſenting bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren doth very well accord with the power of magiſtracy in matters of religion, as it is held by Erastus, Bullingerus, Muſculus, Grotius, Mr. Selden, and Mr. Coleman. This ſame is proved by reaſon, and by the teſtimony of Mr. Burroughs, writing the ſenſe of all his brethren, as alſo by the practiſe of the churches in New-England. 222</item>
               <item>
                  <label>Chap. XXI.</label> That a church made up of many particular churches under one presbytery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with a judiciall power over them, is not of the inſtitution of Chriſt. 234</item>
               <item>
                  <label>Chap. XXII.</label> That the greateſt oppoſers of the diſſenting brethren, namely Salmaſius, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myraldus, and others, have laid down the ſame grounds for the right and power of particular churches, and ſo confuted rather their own fancies, then invalidated the tenets of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. The queſtion whether Rome be a true church briefly reſolved. That Ameſius, and Iohn Meſtrezat late miniſter of Paris, in their writings, have held the power of private
<pb facs="tcp:123664:17"/> churches to be independent from any church-judicatory. 242</item>
               <item>
                  <label>Chap. XXIII.</label> The conſiſtency of the right and power of private churches with the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates power in ordering publick worſhip, proved by the example of the Iewes: that they had through all the land particular convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſynagogues or churches, called alſo col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges or ſchools, where the Prophets and ſons of the Prophets taught, eſpecially on the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day: that they were independent from any church-judicatory. How ſynagogues were altered from their firſt institution, and that being converted into Chriſtian churches, they retained the ſame right, power and way of government. 251</item>
               <item>
                  <label>Chap. XXIV.</label> That the Chriſtian churches under heathens were governed by a confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate diſcipline, or a power of magiſtracy, as the ſynagogues were, appointing men, which Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe calls elders, to decide ſuch matters as otherwiſe were to come under the magiſtrates cognizance. This practiſe is grounded upon 1 Cor. 6. v. 1, 2, &amp;c. and confirmed by Origen, Iuſtin Martyr, Ambroſe and Mr. Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot. That the power of theſe elders continued ſtill under Chriſtian Emperours, with ſome alteration, they erecting in lieu of them Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall courts. That all church-power was the Emperours power. That the very heathen ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
<pb facs="tcp:123664:18"/> knew no other but that all power was annexed to them. 267</item>
               <item>
                  <label>Chap. XXV.</label> That eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction as it is held by the Romiſh church, better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with reaſon and the letter of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture then that of the presbyterian brethren. That ſome Romaniſts have aſcribed more power to the magistrate in ſacred things then the presbyterian brethren. 287</item>
               <item>
                  <label>Chap. XXVI.</label> The deſcription of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication in terms received by most of our op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites, though otherwiſe variouſly defined by them. That for four thouſand years no ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication was in uſe, either among the heathens or the Iewes. An anſwer to ſome objections. That the legall uncleanneſſe was no type of the morall. That the Prieſts jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the leproſy is no plea for excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, nor for eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction. 298</item>
               <item>
                  <label>Chap. XXVII.</label> That neither in the time of Ezra ſuch an excommunication began. That the caſting out of the ſynagogue did not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that excommunication. That there is no ground for it nor practiſe of it in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 307</item>
               <item>
                  <label>Chap. XXVIII.</label> That the whole context Matth. 18. v. 15, 16, 17, and 18. maketh nothing for excommunication; neither Iudas non-admiſſion (if granted) to the Eucharist, nor the delivering of the inceſtuous perſon to
<pb facs="tcp:123664:18"/> Satan, nor yet the ſelf-examination required 1 Cor. 11. 316</item>
               <item>
                  <label>Chap. XXIX.</label> That excommunication is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to common ſenſe and reaſon. 326</item>
               <item>
                  <label>Chap. XXX.</label> That excommunication was mainly ſubſervient to the working of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of iniquity. That the corrupting of the doctrine of the Euchariſt made way for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication. 337</item>
               <item>
                  <label>Chap. XXXI.</label> The Hiſtory of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from the firſt reformation from Popery: how it was received in Geneva, but not ſettled without diſputes and claſhings betwixt the conſiſtory and the magiſtrate. 342</item>
               <item>
                  <label>Chap. XXXII.</label> A continuation of the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of excommunication in France, the Low-Countreys, Scotland, the Palatinate. How it came to paſs, that amongſt reformed ſtates the Scottiſh eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction aſcended to ſuch a height. What plea the reformed churches in France have for excommunication. That it is more juſtifiable among them then in churches under an orthodox magistrate. 353</item>
               <item>
                  <label>Chap. XXXIII.</label> The judgement of ſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines yet living both of the argument in hand, and of the writings of the Author. Of ſome mens ſtrong prejudices againſt, and harſh cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of him. 369</item>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Intend here by way of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to give a brief account how I came to write of this ſubject. Having a little before the beginning of the long Parliament in the year 1639. written a piece in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin againſt the corrupted party of the Engliſh Hierarchy, who made as near approaches as they could towards Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and being a little while after en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in that quarrell, it ſo fell out, that this corrupt party being ſoon foiled by the great torrent of oppoſition they met withall, their oppoſers themſelves, (who were very numerous) did ſoon divide into parts and factions, diſſenting
<pb facs="tcp:123664:20"/> from one another, particularly about church-way and diſcipline, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded me new matter to ſtudy on: which I did, being indifferently affected towards the four kinds of opinions held in the reverend aſſembly of Divines, <hi>viz.</hi> of Epiſcopacy moderated, Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, Independency, and Eraſtianiſme, and for many years together not giving my approbation more to one of them then to the reſt, before ſuch time as I ſhould be well reſolved in the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy. I pittyed for a long time the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous endeavours of each party, tending to make the rent wider, while they ſought rather the victory then the truth: brother became eager againſt brother, branding each other with ſchiſme and hereſy; their principles ſo far dividing them aſunder, that partners in the ſame martyrdome, and who had loſt their ears together, were ſoon toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the ears; and Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> (by name) in ſhewing rather his ſpleen then
<pb facs="tcp:123664:20" rendition="simple:additions"/> his zeal, and Dr. Baſtwick, who ſtiled himſelf the Captain of the presbyterian army, did but powre oyle upon the fire of diſſention, in ſtead of quenching it: as likewiſe did our brethren the Scots, when they wound up their ſtring of ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall juriſdiction to ſuch an height, that it was ready to break, and ranked the Eraſtians in the liſt of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable hereticks; pointing therein par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly at poor and mild Mr. Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, walking almoſt alone in a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly poſture, and who would not give rayling for rayling, but mildly intreated all the brethren that diſſented from him, ſpecially the presbyterians, to give a ſatisfactory anſwer to the queries of the Parliament, touching a juriſdiction and government of the church diſtinct from that of the magiſtrate, and to ſhew in Scripture a place parallel to Matth. 18. v. 17. where by the word <hi>Church</hi> is meant either the miniſters, or a presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian conſiſtory; beſides, to find out in
<pb facs="tcp:123664:21"/> Scripture the name and thing of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, or that it is as well, though not as much, a ſoul-ſaving or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, as preaching of the word and the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, as the reverend presbyterian miniſters would fain have perſwaded him in their reaſons againſt the diſſenting brethren p. 63. At length, being well ſatisfied that truth ſeldome lyes on the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes ſide, as I did much pitty Mr. Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſo did I fall to ſtudy him, and thought it but reaſonable, ere I ſhould join with the generall clamour againſt him, to hear what he could ſay for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And indeed his ſtill voice did more work upon me, then all the thundring voices of his oppoſites. So then being convinced by him, about eight years ſince I put forth in print a tract in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, the drift whereof was only to aſſert the power of the magiſtrate in matters of religion: which ſubject, being but an anſwer to a letter, I handled curſorily
<pb facs="tcp:123664:21"/> and ſuperficially. And while I was upon that work, I was much in charity, as I expreſſe in ſome paſſages of that tract, with the churches of the congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall-way, no leſſe cried out upon then Mr. Coleman, both here and beyond ſeas, ſpecially in France; where, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at Charenton near Paris, a natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſynod condemned them by an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick act: yet then I had no ſuch thought as to conceive or imagine, that the power and right of private churches or congregations, could agree well with the power of the magiſtrate in matters of religion. But ſoon after the publiſhing of this Engliſh tract, my uncle Dr. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew Rivet, whoſe memory is very precious to me and to all the Churches of God, ſent me a Latin manuſcript made by a Divine in France, wherein he endeavoured the confuting of my Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh book, and beſides did much taxe me for favouring the congregationall way ſo much ſpoken-againſt amongſt
<pb facs="tcp:123664:22"/> the reformed churches in France, and expreſſely condemned by a nationall ſynod of theirs. About the ſame time came <hi>Amyraldus</hi> forth in print, as full of bitterneſſe and invectives againſt them as Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> in his <hi>Gangrena.</hi> Both which books (I mean <hi>Amyraldus,</hi> and that which Dr. <hi>Rivet</hi> ſent me) were the cauſe, occaſion and ſubject of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my <hi>Paraeneſis</hi> in Latin. In writing of which I was inſenſibly carried to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and propound wayes of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation betwixt the brethren of the congregationall way, and the aſſertors of that meaſure of power in ſacred things allotted to the magiſtrate by <hi>Muſculus, Bullinger, Gualterus</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſtus;</hi> nothing doubting, but that by theſe propoſitions of reconciliation and accommodation I have given, with a very little yielding on both ſides, the true way and notion of ſettling in ſuch a nation as this, where the ſoveraign magiſtrate is orthodox, might be made
<pb facs="tcp:123664:22"/> out, and the Chriſtian reformed reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion &amp; worſhip eſtabliſhed with more peace, truth and holineſſe of life, then they were ever hitherto ſince the times of the Apoſtles. Theſe notions ſuting more to the purpoſe and intereſt of the Engliſh climat &amp; nation, ought to have been then rather put in Engliſh then Latin, but that I miſtruſted my own abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to appear in publick in any other tongue then Latin or French, and that I had a great mind firſt to diſabuſe other nations, particularly my own countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who were poſſeſſed with ſtrange prejudices againſt the godly party of this nation, as well presbyterians as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by the falſe ſuggeſtions and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of Amyraldus; ſo far, that ſome have expreſſed to me by letters, how much they bewailed the lamentable condition of England, where all religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and fear of God was well-near quite extinct, where there was no church-diſcipline, no excommunication, no
<pb facs="tcp:123664:23"/> ſynods, no ordination, no lay-elders, no Lords prayer or ten commandements reherſed, and no Sacrament of the Lords ſupper adminiſtred. Now this preſent tract coming after the other, and being otherwiſe digeſted and framed, and thoſe controverſies that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern England being chiefly handled therein, and all brought within a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower compaſſe; I do not deſpair but that my preſent deſigne will be excuſed, though I come ſhort of giving ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to all parties. I honour equally the perſons, learning and piety of thoſe that I aſſent to, and diſſent from, no leſſe reſpecting the memory of Mr. Gilleſpie, (an eminent man for wit, piety, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſoundneſſe of faith; but very erroneous in what he ſtiffely maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his Aarons Rod) then that of Mr. Coleman, or of any of Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters now with the Lord: neither do I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ſſe honour the churches of Scotland then thoſe of France. I would fain make
<pb facs="tcp:123664:23"/> all churches and brethren friends with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice to the truth: which I conceive I can retain inviolable, by that temperament I have followed, which giveth unto the magiſtrate his due, and to private churches their right; which denyeth not the presbyterians a diſcipline, but only groundeth it upon a firmer and ſteadier foundation then they have hitherto done themſelves. The Lord reveal theſe truths, which are very much ſubſervient to ſaving truths, to all ſorts of people, that ſo the minds of the people of God may be more ſettled and united to retain the foundation that is in Chriſt Ieſus, not by conſtraint and by an externall coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive juriſdiction, but with a ready mind; and that others, who are otherwiſe led captive by their errors and ignorance in doctrine, but much more ſwayed by this myſtery of iniquity or eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call juriſdiction, may now, by the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of this truth, get freedom, and by
<pb facs="tcp:123664:24"/> it the knowledge of ſaving truths, hid from them becauſe of their bondage. Thus the truth of that ſaying of the Lord Ieſus will be more manifeſt, <hi>If ye know the truth, ye ſhall be free indeed.</hi> Did but thoſe of the Romiſh commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion underſtand that all Papall, Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall, Presbyteriall and Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction, which is not ſubordinate to the power of magiſtracy, is repugnant to Scripture and reaſon, they would ſoon, by the knowledge of this one truth, recover their liberty, and with it the opportunity of having ſaving truths taught them, lying no longer in ſhackles for fear of men, which, though imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie ones, have kept them in as much captivity as if they had been really of iron. For the eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction, and excommunication the product of it, put forth and exerciſed over magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and people by inconſiderable men for coercive power, have hitherto been like to a child leading about an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephant
<pb facs="tcp:123664:24"/> with a thred, who if he knew his own ſtrength, would lead the ſtrongeſt man that is with a ſingle hair. In ſhort, all eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction, without a power of magiſtracy, is like the feathers of an arrow, which can never hit nor have a direct motion, but with the wood to which it is adjoyned: The feathers alone may be made to fly at one, but never to hurt, or make any impreſſion. I will conclude this Preface with the words of Antonius de Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de rep. cap.</hi> 2. who ſays that all eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction is ineffectuall without a power of magiſtracy; <hi>Nihil ſine poteſtate laica obtinebimus; neminem eccleſiaſtica poteſtate poſſumus extrudere, abripere, expellere.</hi> If this, (which is the ſubſtance and the whole drift of my book) can be made out to me not to be Scripture and reaſon, I will not obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natly maintain either this, or any other errour, but acknowledge it both to God and man, as I ought continually all
<pb facs="tcp:123664:25"/> thoſe of my life; which as I hope God will forgive me, ſo, till I be otherwiſe taught, I crave no pardon either of God or man, for holding this, which to ſome is an errour, but to me (and I hope in Gods good time it ſhall be ſo to others) as clear a truth, as that two and two are four.</p>

                  <p>OF the nature of power and authority. That there are but two wayes to bring men to yield obedience; either by a coactive power, or by perſwading them by advice &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell. That there is no medium betwixt command and counſell: which ſheweth that Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction is a name without a thing, not being exerciſed by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them. The diviſion of power, and of the ſubordination and coordination of powers. Many errours and mistakes are
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:123664:26"/> diſcovered about ſubordination and coor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of powers. That the power called Eccleſiaſticall doth ſignifie nothing; and ſuch as it is, is ſubordinate to that of the Magiſtrate.</p>
               </argument>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He nature of power, right, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, obedience, function, law, judgement, are ſo twiſted together and linked, that it is not poſſible to treat of one alone: for as the perfection of power is command, ſo power is exerciſed with lawes by thoſe that have right to it and a function in the ſtate: obedience is a yielding to power, command, lawes, counſells and advices.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Potestas,</hi> power, denotes three things; Perſon, Right and Office. Often it is taken for the perſon or perſons that are the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Magiſtrate: it is alſo oppoſite to <hi>jus</hi> or right; thus <hi>Tacitus,</hi> in the third Book of his annals, ſaith <hi>that right is weakned when power comes in.</hi> In a large ſenſe it is defined, A faculty to bring any thing to paſſe, either by right or by wrong: or thus; A faculty in the agent to move it ſelf towards the patient either neceſſarily, or at the will of the agent: neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily in a naturall body, but arbitrarily in an intelligence either Divine, or Angelicall and humane.</p>
               <p>Authority as it hath relation to man, is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:123664:26"/> in the agent, to move it ſelf at the will of the patient: for power is exerciſed over men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their will; but authority is over thoſe that willingly yield, and are perſwaded and convinced: yet ſometimes power and authority are promiſcuouſly uſed. But philoſophers, huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, and ſtatiſts uſually aſcribe authority to men, and writings, that put no coercion or force to mens actions: thus they attribute great authority to the <hi>placita</hi> and <hi>reſponſa</hi> of wiſe and prudent men, whoſe judgements, dictates and definitions who ever giveth no credit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, is taxed of fooliſhneſſe not of rebellion or diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: and ſo to men, commendable for their age, wiſedome, prudence and experience; as the Heathens did to their Plato, Socrates, Ariſtote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, Zeno, Princes of Schools, who captivated the minds, not the bodies, of their hearers. 'Tis in that ſenſe Cicero, in his firſt Book of Offices, in the very beginning, ſpeaks of the great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that Cratippus and Athens had, though neither of them had power either of legiſlation or of juriſdiction: and in his Epiſtles, he often mentioneth thoſe that were in great favour and authority with Caeſar and Pompey, although they had no power of juriſdiction over them. Albeit Grammarians ſhould put no difference betwixt power &amp; authority; yet nature, cuſtome, and the practiſe of all nations, yea the holy Scripture diſtinguiſheth power of juriſdiction and command, which impoſeth penalties upon
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:123664:27"/> the tranſgreſſours, from that authority which enforceth not the outward man, but only work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon the ſoul, perſwadeth and begetteth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, reſpect and reverence. Power of juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is alwayes attended with command, and followed with obedience, either active or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, to the command of the power: but autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, being for the moſt part attended with ſome of theſe, old age, gravity, wiſedome, prudence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, ſtrength of reaſon, eloquence, by its exhortations, dehortations, counſells, produceth in thoſe that are wrought upon and perſwaded, the effect of obedience, not with conſtraint, but freely and voluntarily; not for fear of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be inflicted by men in caſe of non-obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but either (may be) for fear of offending God, or becauſe ſtrength of reaſon maketh one yield to a truth; or one yields to authority to avo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d an evill, or purchaſe ſome good. Briefly, the holy Scripture, reaſon, mans wiſedome and reach, nature and cuſtome, yea all tongues of men, can utter or imagine but two wayes by which a man is drawn to yield obedience, or put upon that duty to obey and yield: either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the command of a power puts a force or penalty on the outward man; or becauſe the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of counſell, advice and exhortation hath ſo convinced the inward man, and perſwaded him, that it muſt needs move the outward to yield an obey. Plautus in Bacchides act. 4. ſc. 7. could ſay, <hi>ego neque te jubeo, neque veto, neque ſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deo;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:123664:27"/> I neither bid thee, nor forbid thee, nor yet perſwade thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sure the holy Scripture maketh uſe but of theſe two wayes to draw obedience from a man, 2. Theſſal. 3. v. 12. <hi>We command, and exhort you.</hi> Curtius <hi>lib.</hi> 5. ſpeaking of the ſouldiers of Darius, who were rather drawn by command then that they approved his counſell, ſaith, <hi>Regis imperium magis quam conſilium ſequeban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur:</hi> and Livy in his 29. book, <hi>nec imperium illud meum, ſed conſilium; this is not my command, but advice.</hi> So in all ſtates, councels &amp; aſſemblies, civill or religious, men bring their deſignes to an end, either by adviſing and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelling, or making lawes and conſtitutions in order to their commands. Cicero, in his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Rabirius, ſaith, that <hi>the ſoveraign counſell is ſeated in the Senate, but the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign command in the Conſuls:</hi> and Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, ſpeaking of the Germane and Gallick Kings, ſaith that they were endowed with a perſwaſive power, but not with a commanding power: ſo Curtius <hi>lib.</hi> 6. of the Kings of Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in capitall matters, <hi>the power of the Kings was little worth, except they could by their authority perſwade.</hi> The like may we ſay of the power of Synods or church-aſſemblies, without a power of magiſtracy, that their canons and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, except men be convinced and perſwaded to yield and aſſent, are of ſmall validity.</p>
               <p>The moſt learned Divines did never put a <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:123664:28"/> between command, and counſell or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.

As I know no medium betwixt theſe; ſo I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that a juriſdiction presbyteriall, claſſicall, ſynodicall, or even congregationall, can ever have any workings that run in a middle chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell, and are neither acts of magiſtracy, nor of counſell and advice: but a conſiſtory or ſynod muſt needs exerciſe either one of theſe two juriſd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ctions ſingly, or both jointly. For example, a ſynod of Dordrecht diſpenſing both juriſdictions, the one from Chriſt, the other from the magiſtrate, may by the one convince ſome remonſtrant miniſters of the truth of the five points handled; but by the other juriſdiction they will remove the obſtinate remonſtrants from their flock. Thus a ſynode of Arians, if au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed by the magiſtrate, may compell the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Biſhops to relinquiſh their ſees, but never perſwade them to change their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
               <p>But the Eccleſiaſticall hiſtory affordeth us a notable example, proving the nullity of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall and Presbyteriall power, which is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advice, counſell, nor the inward juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by which the inward man is perſwaded and convinced, nor a power of magiſtracy compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the outward man to obedience. Paulus Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſatenus, being by a Synod of Antioch excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:123664:29"/> and depoſed from his ſee, and one Domnus voted to be in his place; Paulus ſlighting the ſynods judgement, and the ſynod being not inveſted with any power to execute their ſentence againſt Paulus Samoſatenus had recourſe to their Emperour Aurelianus a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, who not onely judged in the behalf of the ſynod of Antioch, but actually outed Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, and put Domnus in his place. This hiſtory we have in the ſeventh book of Euſebius ch. 39. I aske here, what was the ſentence of the ſynod againſt Paulus Samoſatenus, but advice and counſell, and a declaration of their mind, that Paulus deſerved to be excommunicated, and put out of his place, and Domnus to take his place? and indeed that ſentence of excommunication and depoſition ſignified juſt nothing, untill power of execution went along with it.</p>
               <p>All this is ſufficient to evince that all juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction Papall, Epiſcopall and Presbyteriall, is a name without a thing, if it be not coercive; elſe that it is merely a counſell and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by which if a man be not perſwaded to obey, the tranſgreſſour cannot incurre any pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, and thereby be deprived of life, liberty and goods: ſo that all cenſure, as excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which is not a product of magiſtracy and a coercive juriſdiction, falls to the ground, and is like the bulls of the Pope, which hurt none but thoſe that are afraid of them. For the act of excommunication muſt be a product of a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:123664:29"/> commanding juriſdiction, or of counſell and advice; we having clearly ſeen that there is no medium betwixt theſe two. If it be an effect of coercive juriſdiction, then it muſt be a product of magiſtracy delegated by the ſoveraign power without, or exerciſed within the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of thoſe that do excommunicate. Either way excommunication finds no footing, ſince it is not a mere advice, nor, as they will have it, a mere product of coercive power; which the very Papiſts, at leaſt thoſe that newly came from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, namely Antonius de Dominis, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be neceſſarily joyned with all Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall ſentences; elſe that they were mere decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the mind. Theſe be his words <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de rep. ca.</hi> 1. <hi>Nos potius Epiſcopi &amp; Min ſtri decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramus eſſe excludendum, quam actu corporali excludimus; we Biſhops and Miniſters do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declare that one is deſerving to be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, then we exclude him bodily;</hi> one being an act of command, the other of advice. Thus in the 2. chapter he ſaith, that no church can excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate without magiſtracy: <hi>Nihil ſine pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate laica obtinebimus; neminem Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca poteſtate poſſumus extrudere, abripere, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe two juriſdictions, the one of advice and counſell, the other of magiſtracy, neither of them being like the presbyteriall juriſdiction challenged, may be inſtanced in all kinds of ſocieties, families, meetings, religious or civill;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:123664:30"/> whereas our presbyterian brethren cannot ſo much as produce one ſingle act exerciſed in a conſiſtory or ſynod which is not an effect of magiſtracy, or of counſell and advice, and is not either compelling the outward man, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading the inward. Thus a father of a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to bring his ſon to walk in the wayes of God, muſt go about it either by perſwaſion, or by compulſion, hale him perforce to church, hoping that God may there work upon his heart. Thus a private church, by the juriſdiction of the keyes and power of perſwaſion, may win a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but by the other juriſdiction will expell him, and put him out of the congregation.</p>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:123664:30"/> good and bad; men into elect and reprobates; the Teſtament into new and old; the people of God into Iewes and gentiles; the whole man into fleſh and ſpirit, new man and old; things enjoyed into ſpirituall and temporall; Gods Kingdome into earthly and heavenly. And thus, to come to our purpoſe, there be two powers, one internall, the other externall; two ſwords, the ſword of the word or ſpirit in the miniſtery, and the ſword of magiſtracy; two courts, one outward, called <hi>forum externum,</hi> governing the outward man, and impoſing lawes on him; the other <hi>forum internum,</hi> governing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, perſwading and convincing it. So for judgement and obedience; judgement is either a commanding, or counſelling, adviſing, and may be called judgement of approbation: obedience is either to commands or counſells. He were here a cunning Oed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>pus, who could find room for Eccleſiaſticall court, judgement and law, or find a medium at leaſt of participation betwixt thoſe two juriſdictions, the one coercive or of magiſtracy, the other perſwaſive and exerciſed by perſwaſion; ſuch is that which is exerciſed in the word, to which (as St. Peter ſpeaketh) man yieldeth not by conſtraint, but willingly and with a ready mind.</p>
               <p>Even all actions where art, mans wiſedome, induſtrie, nature, and Gods bleſſing and grace do concur, do evidently ſhew the neceſſity of this dichotomy, and the nullity of what is ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:123664:31"/> to be interpoſed betwixt the power of magiſtracy and the power of miniſtery, betwixt the power of compulſion and the power of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion. For example, the acts of magiſtracy are like the acts of a plough-man, who hath a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over his ground to plough it, dung it, then harrow it, and ſcatter his ſeed: but the acts of miniſtery, or rather the acts of God in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, by working upon the heart, convincing, and making the man to follow willingly Gods call, are like the other acts, which are not ſo much in the power of the plough-man; as in Gods ſending the rain upon his ploughed and ſown land, bleſſing or fruſtrating all his paſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
               <p>This being the nature of power, next is to be conſidered how it is divided, and how powers are ſubordinate or coordinate. I could never conceive that power can be branched but into two, <hi>viz.</hi> externall and internall. The inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall power is either divine, or of art: the divine power is either naturall, or of the word; which is either ordinary, or extraordinary. Ordinary is upon theſe that are either convinced, or hardned: the extraordinary is either of prophecy, or of miracles: that of prophecy is either under the old, or the new Teſtament.</p>
               <p>The externall power is either private, or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. Private power is that freedome in every private man or ſociety to act things and in things, wherein the publick is little or nothing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:123664:31"/> concerned, and no way diſturbed: which power doth much belong to private churches, as we ſhall ſee in another place.</p>
               <p>The publick externall power is either ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, or ſubordinate and delegated. The ſoveraign is either of legiſlation, or of juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. The ſubordinate is a power delegated by the ſoveraign to cities, provinces, families, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties of whatſoever kind, as churches, ſchools, colledges, halls, univerſities, corporations: ſo that there is no externall power commanding obedience under ſome penalty, making lawes, and compelling the outward man, wherewith maſters, husbands, fathers, halls, corporations, ſocieties, churches are inveſted, but is derived from the ſoveraign externall power, which we call power of magiſtracy. Here is no more room for eccleſiaſticall power then for maritall, pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, deſpoticall, as neither for medicall if you will, and ſo for pharmaceuticall, military, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and the like; all which are a like ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the ſoveraign externall power, called the power of magiſtracy: for I do conceive that church-power or juriſdiction are as improperly called eccleſiaſticall, as if the juriſdiction where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with a colledge of phyſitians might be inveſted were called medicall or phyſicall; ſince a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, a phyſitian, a merchant, as ſuch, are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with juriſdiction: which cannot be ſaid of a juſtice of peace, of a conſtable, or of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geant, who as ſuch are inveſted with a power

               <p>The coordinate powers, when neither of them is ſubordinate to the other, are the power of the word in the miniſtery, and the power of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy: the one being Gods ſpirits juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over the hearts and aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this having already been diſproved by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I will alledge but one of their own, namely Triglandius <hi>de poteſtate eccleſiaſtica</hi> againſt Vedelius, as good as confeſſing he cannot tell what to make of that eccleſiaſticall power, and where it muſt be placed: for in the deſcription he makes of the power of the magiſtrate about ſacred things, and that of the power of the word, which yet he calls eccleſiaſticall, he leaves no room for a presbyterian eccleſiaſticall power of excommunicating, depoſing, and making lawes <hi>authoritatively,</hi> as they ſpeak. Though, I ſay,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:123664:32"/> he calls that power eccleſiaſticall, yet it hath but merely the name of it; for he giveth ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription to it, as I could give no other to the power of the word.

But this power none of the divines attribute to the magiſtrate.</hi> There is nothing in this deſcription that belongeth to the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall presbyterian power, ſuch as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſpie would give us: for excommunication doth not ſtrike at the ſoul, but at the body; and the oppoſition he maketh of the things he likens it to, do ſhew he ſpeaketh of ſuch a power as is called the power of the reſurrection, Philip. 3. v. 10. and the power of God, Rom. 1. v. 16. and by which we are the ſons of God, Ioh. 1. v. 12. which properties cannot belong to the power of excommunication, and of making lawes in a ſynod, which being carried by the major part of votes, though it were but of one, oblige all men to obedience.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:123664:33"/> by the keyes underſtood both keyes, of the word, and of diſcipline. To that I ſay, 1. that Triglandius deſcription of eccleſiaſticall power reacheth only to the ſoul, and not to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the outward man by diſcipline: 2. that a key is an admiſſion to the Kingdom of grace, and not to a viſible aſſembly: 3. a key is an inſtrument to get in thoſe that are without, if they pleaſe to come in willingly; not to force them in, or to keep them from entering; nor to caſt out thoſe that are within by excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, except they deſire to go out of themſelves. They uſe to expell men with ſtaves and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>udgels, but not with a key, except it be taken by the wrong end, and to a wrong uſe. What Triglan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius ſaith, that this power none of the divines attribute to the magiſtrate, is true of the power of the word in converting from darkneſſe to light; which indeed none of the divines aſcribe to the magiſtrate. But if he had ſpoken of a power of presbyterian eccleſiaſticall judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, it had not been true what he ſaith, that none of the divines attribute it to the magiſtrate; for it is the opinion of Bullingerus, Muſculus, Gual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus, great and famous divines, who take off from the miniſters all ſuch presbyteriall power, and give it to the true owner, even to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian magiſtrates.</p>
               <p>Now let us ſee how farre he extendeth the power of the magiſtrate in ſacred things; by which it is plain he affords no room for preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:123664:33"/> power to interpoſe between the power whereof we have juſt now ſeen the deſcription, and the power of the magiſtrate. Theſe be his words ch. 16. p. 317. <hi>It belongeth to the civil power to deliberate what religion he will have to be exerciſed among his ſubjects: if he doth remove the true religion, he abuſeth indeed his power, yet for all that his power muſt not be denied.</hi> I would fain know by what power the magiſtrate doth theſe things: Is it an eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall, or civil? If civil, then ſome acts of the eccleſiaſticall power are ſubordinate to the civil: if eccleſiaſticall, I ask whether it is coor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to that of the miniſters power, or ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to the civil power. If ſubordinate, 'tis all I ſay. If coordinate, then it is ten times more abſurd to fain two equall powers and judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries over the ſame perſons, and in the ſame cauſe and matter, as we ſhall ſee in another place.</p>
               <p>To clear all miſtakes about ſubordination of powers:</p>
               <p n="1">1. When we ſay that eccleſiaſticall power is ſubordinate to the power of the magiſtrate, we do not underſtand a ſubordination of functions; for neither the functions of phyſitians, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, profeſſours of arts, no more then that of miniſters, are ſubordinate to magiſtracy; but that whatever juriſdiction miniſters, phyſitians, merchants, or profeſſours of arts have, is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to the magiſtrate. And indeed this
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:123664:34"/> hath been one great cauſe to deny a ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of eccleſiaſticall to civil; becauſe perſons, and functions, and the affairs about theſe fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, having alwayes been ſeparated, this errour hath ſoon crept in, that juriſdiction and rule muſt be alſo ſeparated: but if juriſdictions have need to be ſeparated and diſtinct, becauſe functions are ſo; there would be as many juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions in a ſtate, as there be profeſſours of arts and ſciences. And ſince functions that have no affinity with magiſtracy make no diſtinction of juriſdiction; much leſſe the ſacred function and magiſtracy, that are ſo near a kin, have need to have ſeverall juriſdictions. And indeed the affinity is great; both tending to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of the ſoveraign good, and for many 1000. years the ſame perſon having been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with them both.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a great miſtake of ſome, who, becauſe a juriſdiction is from God, and ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to him, deny it to be ſubordinate to the magiſtrate. For is not the maritall or paternall power-ſubordinate to God, and yet to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate? and is not deſpoticall power ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to God, Coloſ. 4. and yet to the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Neither do we ſay, that all thoſe whoſe juriſdiction is ſubordinate to the magiſtrate, ought to exerciſe their power by authority from the magiſtrate only: for they muſt do it as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n all juſt and lawfull things; 2. not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:123664:34"/> with an eye-ſubmiſſion, (as St. Paul ſaith of ſervants) as men-pleaſers, but as ſubject to Chriſt, and from a principle of conſcience, though there were no magiſtrates at all.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This conſideration will remove many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, that it may well ſtand that a power, a command, a law, a precept may be both from God &amp; from the magiſtrate: thus the decalogue is as well a law of the magiſtrate, as of God. Yea I maintain, that a command or law of God hath no force of law in the court of man, or in any presbytery, ſynod or aſſembly whatſoever, bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to active or paſſive obedience, except it hath the ſtamp of magiſtracy, and be publiſhed anew by the ſoveraign magiſtrate; and that no man can be puniſhed legally for robbing and ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yea not for killing, much leſſe can he be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, except there be a law of man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt robbers and murtherers, and that ſome magiſtracy impowereth churches or ſynods to paſſe a ſentence of excommunication.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This alſo hath been a great miſtake, which made many deny a ſubordination of eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call to civil, becauſe thoſe that embrace the true religion, and live under thoſe that hate them or perſecute them, endeavour as to have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion independent from the magiſtrate, ſo alſo a juriſdiction.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Another errour in making the church ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction not ſubordinate, but wholly inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent from the magiſtrate, is, this aſſertion
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:123664:35"/> eaſily deſcending into the minds of thoſe that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect rule and juriſdiction, <hi>viz.</hi> that the end of magiſtracy is outward peace and quietneſſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and purchaſing all means to the attaining of the preſervation of temporall life, wealth and proſperity; having nothing to do with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the eternall good and happineſſe of the ſoul. But this errour is not only refuted by the very heathens, but alſo by the moſt learned or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Divines, both Engliſh and others. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus on the 13. to the Romans <hi>dubio</hi> 5. ſaith the end of the magiſtrate is not only the civil good, but alſo the ſpirituall good of the ſubjects, that religion may flouriſh in the church according to the word of God: and ſo Junius Meditat. on the 122. Pſalm tom. 1. col. 721. ſaith, that the magiſtrate is to procure by divine and humane right the good of the ſpirituall Kingdom of Chriſt. But Antonius de Dominis <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publica eccleſiaſtica cap.</hi> 5. §. 1. is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix and nervous to prove, that he that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted from God with a power to purchaſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall felicity, is alſo inveſted with a power to promote the ſpirituall.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is alſo a great errour, to make a coor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of powers ſeated in the ſame perſons. For, if it could be imagined that one part of the people were the Church, and the other part the Commonwealth, they might be alſo ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined independent one from another: thus a ſociety of merchants, and a colledge of ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:123664:35"/> may be well imagined to be corporations ſo independent one from the other, that none of the ſociety of merchants are part of the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and none of the colledge are part of the ſociety. But granting that the ſame perſons are members of the ſociety of merchants and of the colledge of ſcholars, the command, law, diſcipline of thoſe two corporations, as long as they admit the ſame members, muſt have either a perpetuall conflict and claſhing, or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of one corporation muſt be ſubordinate to the command of the other; or elſe if they be both coordinate, they muſt alſo be both equally ſubordinate to a power ſet over them both. This is the caſe between the Church and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. Granting that the ſame perſons are members of the Commonwealth, and of the Church, it is not poſſible to make theſe two juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions coordinate, and yet ſubſiſt together in peace, love and amity: and without one diſturbs the other, they muſt joyntly agree to have one power over them; or the law, injunction and commands of one, muſt be ſubordinate to the lawes of the other.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The grandeſt inconvenience in this coor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of powers and juriſdictions is, that the ſame perſons being members of ſocieties un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both theſe powers, and ſubmitting to the commands of both, ſhall be in continuall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity which to obey, if both do not command one thing. There is ſuch a communion in mens
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:123664:36"/> actions, cauſes, relations, functions, callings, commands, duties, juriſdictions, freedoms, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, among thoſe that live under one ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign power, and within the precincts of one juriſdiction, that it is impoſſible that any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward action can be performed in whatever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation a man be conſidered, as husband, maſter, father, paſtor, lawyer, phyſitian, merchant, at home or in church, in a ſynod, or in a city, or hall, except they all are modified, ruled and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by one ſupreme juriſdiction; otherwiſe the ſaying of Tacitus would prove true, <hi>ubi plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res imperant, nemo obſequitur,</hi> where there be many coordinate powers, there is none found to obey. When a magiſtrate doth command a ſubject to attend him in the wars, this command doth exempt him from the commands and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions that may be made to him as he is a ſon, member of a conſiſtory, or of a ſynod, or of ſome other corporation: therefore, when the King of Scotland in the year 1582. commanded the magiſtrate of Edenburgh to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain and feaſt a French Ambaſſadour on a ſet day, and the presbytery of Edenburgh, to croſſe this command, had enjoyned a faſt upon the ſame day, ſince both commands could not be obeyed at once by the magiſtrate of Edenburgh, either the magiſtrates commands muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to thoſe of the presbytery, or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the presbytery muſt be ſubordinate to thoſe of the magiſtrate; or elſe the different
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:123664:36"/> commands of both muſt be ſubordinate to a third power, above both presbytery and magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</p>
               <p>I have brought in my Paraeneſis a cloud of witneſſes, Martyr, Muſculus, Gualterus, Iunius, Pareus, Caſſander, Hooker, Antonius de Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis, proving the neceſſity, that the power cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led eccleſiaſticall ſhould be ſubordinate to that of the magiſtrate. I will only alledge Muſculus, in whom we ſhall ſee the ſenſe of all the reſt; <hi>loc. com. de magiſtratibus. The way and nature of government cannot bear that in the ſame people there be two authentick powers, two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe legiſlations and dominations, except it be by ſubordination; as there is no place for two heads upon one body.</hi> Learned D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Hammond, who is neither for Geneva presbytery, nor of Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus opinion, nor yet of Muſculus, Bullingerus &amp; Gualterus, who made little account of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication; yet he holds, <hi>that eccleſiaſticall power is ſubject to the civil magistrate, who in all cauſes over all perſons is acknowledged ſupreme under Chriſt.</hi> Theſe be his words, in his tract of the power of the keyes, p. 87. though by them he overthroweth all power in mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Biſhops of excommunicating indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently from the magiſtrate, which yet he ſtrives to aſſert againſt Eraſtus. M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Rutherford and M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Gilleſpie think, that if it were granted that the magiſtrate is Chriſts viceregent, it would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert wholly the grounds upon which eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

               <p>I ſhould in this chapter, as I intended at firſt, ſhew the vanity and nullity of the multitude of diviſions and ſubdiviſions of eccleſiaſticall power, which, like wooden legs to a lame man, muſt be more in number, and worſe for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and unfitter to walk upon, then good legs of fleſh and bones to another: for whereas this muſt have but two, the other muſt have as good as four, and yet very bad ones. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our principles, theſe two only things well conſidered and retained, namely, <hi>the power of the word in the ministery,</hi> and the <hi>externall power of magiſtracy,</hi> will clear and decide the whole controverſy, and aſſert the right of churches, and the power of magiſtracy in them and over them: whereas all the limbs of the eccleſiaſticall power, which are more in number then the pillars of Salisbury church, are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to prop up the eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction independent from that of the magiſtrate.

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the nature and diviſion of right divine and humane. In vain do they call things of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine poſitive right, which are acted by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall right: ſuch are many church acts. Things that are of divine right may be ſaid to be of humane right, and on the contrary, thoſe things that are of humane right may be ſaid to be of divine right: which is an argument that, by right, power cannot be divided betwixt clergie and laity.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>RIght, in Latine <hi>jus,</hi> differs from <hi>law,</hi> as rule from juſtice: for law is the rule it ſelf, but right is the juſtice of the rule. Sometimes it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth that vertue called in Greek <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which abates of the rigour of the law. But right in generall that comprehendeth all rights, is that which is due to every one by either equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that is by the law of nature and of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or by an inſtituted law. Sometimes right is ſo ſtiled, by thoſe that will call it ſo, becauſe they have the better ſword: thus Arioviſtus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered Caeſar, that right of war was, that the victor ſhould give law to the vanquiſhed. By naturall right we underſtand that which is conſonant to right reaſon.</p>
               <p>Commonly right is divided into private and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:123664:38"/> publick. Private right is the ſame with perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall right; which is had either independently from maſters, parents, husbands; thoſe that have it are called <hi>ſui juris:</hi> or dependently upon maſters and parents. The publick right is either naturall, as when St. Paul ſaith that the Gentils do naturally the things of the law; or inſtituted, and is called poſitive right, having a poſitive rule, which is given either by God or by men. God giveth it 1. to certain perſons, as to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac, Iacob, Moſes, &amp;c. 2. to a certain people, as to Iſrael: 3. to all men, either for a time, as the law of not eating bloud; or for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as the Sacraments, and the preaching of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>It is not poſſible to give an exact diviſion of right. Many things that are of naturall right are alſo of divine and inſtituted right; ſo, many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine precepts, as is the decalogue, are of humane inſtitution: but cuſtome hath prevailed, that theſe precepts ſhould be of poſitive right, that have no footſtep in nature, as is the obſervation of a ſeventh day, the forbidding of eating the tree of death and life. We ſay things to be of naturall right, in which we are rather born then brought up, and which are naturally imprinted in us; as is the law defined by Tullius 1. <hi>leg. law is a ſoveraign way imbred in nature, commanding things to be done, and forbidding things contrary.</hi> By that law we know many things inſtituted and delivered in Scripture: as
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:123664:38"/> that obedience is due by children to parents, by ſervants to maſters, by wives to husbands; that theft, murder is to be avoided; and, to come nearer to our purpoſe, that there is one God; that he muſt be worſhipped; that he cannot be worſhipped except it be in meetings and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies in one place; that in thoſe aſſemblies all muſt be done in order; that the whole aſſembly, if it be numerous, muſt be governed by ſome choice men choſen out of the whole body, and deputed from them; likewiſe the law of nature and of nations teacheth us, that what is agreed on by the major part of thoſe deputies, muſt ſtand for a law; that that law muſt be obeyed under penalties: albeit if we be ruled by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive law of God, we are not ſo much to follow the number of ſuffrages and votes in carrying of a law, as the ſoundneſſe and goodneſſe of the law. This alſo is a law of nature, practiſed even by all nations, that ſoveraign command about ſacred things, yea the chief ſacerdotall function, belongeth to the ſoveraign power; of which law a part hath been abrogated by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed law of the Scripture, which did ſo ſever the ſacerdotall function from the regall, that the regall ſtill kept the ſoveraign juriſdiction about ſacred things. This is alſo a law of nature and nations, that every aſſembly and convention of men ſhould have power to chuſe, admit, and exclude members of their own ſociety, and to perform all acts conducing to their ſubſiſtence.</p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:123664:39"/>
               <p>Thoſe rights of nature God by a ſuperiour di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate or command in the Scripture hath not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated; for grace doth not take away, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects nature. So that no member of a ſociety is to recede from its naturall right, liberty, and priviledge, except by a poſitive law of God or man he is reſtrained and commanded other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
               <p>Thoſe rights of the naturall law being well underſtood, it will eaſily be ſtated, by what right or power, naturall, civil, politicall, (I had almoſt ſaid eccleſiaſticall) deſpoticall, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, maritall, not only every ſociety, family, but alſo each member acteth: for the greateſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake about eccleſiaſticall power is, that many acts of miniſters and people are ſaid to be of ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall, miniſteriall, divine, poſitive right, which indeed are acts grounded upon the law of nature and nations, and are derived from a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and common prudence, that every ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and free man maketh uſe of in ordering all kinds of ſocieties, fraternities, corporations, whereof he is a member, without needing to flie to a power taking its right and name as if it were of another claſſis, nature and kind, and independent from any other. For as a man being at once maſter of a great family, fellow of a colledge of phyſitians, a citizen, and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber both of the Commonwealth, and of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ment, beſides of a church, is not ſaid to act by ſo many kinds of rights and powers, as his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:123664:39"/> are in the Commonwealth, as if in his col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he acted by a medicall or academicall power, in city or hall by a civicall power, in a church by an eccleſiaſticall or church power; all being ſuppoſed to be alike coordinate, and not being ſubordinate to the ſupreme power: ſo naturall power, right, liberty, and prudence in ordering all kinds of affairs, ſocieties, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, are no otherwiſe diſtinct in kind or ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, then a yard that meaſured cloth differs from that which meaſured ſearge: as a yard is alike appliable to ſilk and thred, and the ſame hammer will knock in an iron naile and a wooden pin; ſo the ſame power and prudence governeth the church and a colledge.</p>
               <p>It is alſo obſervable, that a man being at once a member of a family, hall, city, Parliament, church, doth not act alwaies according to the quality of his relation, function, and place, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick or private; not acting as a phyſitian, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or husband, but as a judge; and not as a church-member, but as a free member of a ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Thus a member of a colledge of phyſitians joyneth in conſultation with his brethren in a caſe of phyſick, as a phyſitian; but in making lawes, regulating the practiſe of phyſick, and the apothecaries entrenching upon the phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, he doth not act as a phyſitian, but as a judge, and as a perſon inveſted with judiciall power from the ſtate. The ſame phyſitian in a Parliament, upon the matter and queſtion of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:123664:40"/> phyſick and of phyſitians to be regulated, may ſpeak pertinently of his art as a phyſitian, but doth not vote &amp; give his conſent to the making of a law about phyſick as a phyſitian, but as a judge of the land. Likewiſe, to be ſure by what right paſtors and people act in the church, the acts and actions of a paſtor or church-member are to be conſidered either as acts of paſtors and of church-members, or as they are acts of rulers and members of a ſociety. The act of a paſtor as paſtor, is to diſcharge all miniſteriall function commanded in the revealed word, and not declared by any dictate of nature. In thoſe acts I ſee no right of juriſdiction, but over the inward man, when by the power of the word the ſinner is brought to the obedience of the croſſe of Chriſt. The acts of church-members, as ſuch, are either in relation to the paſtor, or of one member to another. In relation to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, the acts are to ſubmit to the miniſter ruling them, and diſpenſing unto them the word. They may have that liberty to try his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and to do as they of Beroea, who ſearched the Scriptures, to know whether it was ſo as St. Paul preached unto them: this is alſo an act of every faithfull member of the church, not to aſſent to any doctrine, becauſe it hath been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto by the major part of ſuffrages: but in things that concern order and diſcipline, to yield to the conſtitutions agreed on by the major part of the aſſembly; ſo that by them the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:123664:40"/> bond of charity and the truth of the doctrine be not violated and perverted. The acts of church-members relating one to another are, to bear one anothers burthens, to forgive and edifie one another, to preferre another before him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>The acts of paſtors and church-members as they are endowed with a power common to all other ſocieties, are 1. to do all things order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; 2. to make a diſcipline ſutable to time and place, ſince there is not in the Scripture a poſitive precept concerning the ſame; 3. to oblige every member to the lawes of the diſcipline voted by the major part of the members; 4. to admit and expell the members which by the major part are thought fit ſo to be. Many other acts are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the ſame members not as church-members: as to appeal to a ſuperiour tribunall, as magiſtracy or ſynod, in caſe of wrong ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for they do not oppoſe a juſt defence to wrong by any other right, then a member of any ſociety ſhould do. Thus an aſſembly of Chriſtians meeting in a church way, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted or aſſaulted in their temple by rude and wicked men, doth not oppoſe a juſt defence by weapons or otherwiſe as church-members, but as men inveſted with naturall power againſt an unjuſt violence.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, miniſters and people have many act<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ngs within the ſphear of Chriſtian duties, which are not proper to them as Chriſtians and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:123664:41"/> members of churches; being like in that to a phyſitian, who doth not build as a phyſitian, or to a counſellor of State carrying a letter to a friend, who acts then the part of a letter-bearer: thus a father hath a power over his ſon by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall paternall right; but he doth inſtruct him in a Goſpell way by a paternall Chriſtian right and duty, grounded upon a poſitive precept of the Scripture: thus Queen Mary of England eſtabliſhed a religion by a naturall right, power and duty annexed to all ſoveraignty to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſacred things with a ſoveraign authority; but Queen Elizabeth did overthrow the falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and did ſet up Proteſtant religion, not only by the ſame right that Queen Mary had, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by a poſitive right, as principall church-member, as Ezechiah, Ioſiah, &amp;c. appointed by God to be heads, and nurſing fathers and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the churches.</p>
               <p>The ſame things, lawes and conſtitutions that are of divine right, are alſo of humane right: and likewiſe the things that are of humane right, in a good ſenſe may be ſaid to be of divine right. Things are ſaid to be of divine or humane right, either becauſe the matter of right is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Gods worſhip or humane policie, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God or man is the author of them. Thus the lawes of the Iewes, regulating their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, are ſaid both to be of divine and humane right: divine, becauſe God is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of them; humane, becauſe they order all
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:123664:41"/> affairs about mine and thine, right and wrong, and betwixt man and man.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe many things have been inſtituted with great wiſedome by magiſtrates and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, which may well be ſaid to be both of divine and humane right: Divine, becauſe they further the purity of worſhip and power of godlineſſe; humane, becauſe they were inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by men, and may ſuffer alteration and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</p>
               <p>So things that are every way of divine right, both for the matter and inſtitution, as the eating of the paſſeover, and the obſervation of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, may be ſaid to be of humane right, becauſe commanded and enjoyned by humane autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. The very calling of ſynods, which they ſay is of divine inſtitution, both for their inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is Apoſtolick, and for the matter that is handled in them, none but a papiſt did yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to be the Emperours and magiſtrates right. Thus faſting, prayer, publick humiliation, though duties to be performed by divine right and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, are alſo of humane right, as commanded and ordered by the magiſtrate in a publick way. Thus it was the good Kings of Iuda's right, and none can blame them for it, to command faſting and prayers.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, things that are every way of humane right, and made by man, and have for their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the regulating of humane affairs, as are the lawes concerning conduit-pipes, buildings, fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:123664:42"/> chaſes, &amp;c. may conveniently be ſaid to be of divine right, becauſe by divine right they oblige the conſcience.</p>
               <p>Hence we may gather, how impoſſible it is to ſhare betwixt laity and clergy by Divine and humane right, power of legiſlation and juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, about things, cauſes and perſons; as that paſtors and miniſters ſhould be over things that are of divine right, and magiſtrates over thoſe things that are of humane right, without claſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of powers, cauſes and perſons; there being ſuch a complication of right, cauſes and perſons, that they cannot be ſo much as ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined a ſunder: beſides that the preaching of the Goſpell and magiſtracy do comprehend all actions of man, and parts of life, wherein men ought to live godly, juſtly and ſoberly.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The nature, matter, forme, and author of law. The canons and ſentences of Church-judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories have no force of law, except they receive it from the ſanction of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate. The defects in the diviſion of lawes into Divine and humane; into morall, cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall and politick; and into Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and civil.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>INtending chiefly to prove the vanity and nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a power called eccleſiaſticall diſtinct
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:123664:42"/> from that of the magiſtrate, ſince alſo no power of legiſlation nor of juriſdiction can be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed without a power to make a law, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand obedience to the law; it will be requiſite to know the nature of law; that ſo making good, that Church-officers are not inveſted with any power to make lawes, or to command obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to them, all their juriſdiction may be brought to juſt nothing.</p>
               <p>Law ſometimes is taken for a dictate of nature, or right reaſon, and conſent of nations: thus they ſay of Aeſop, that though he was free by nature, yet the law of man enſlaved him: gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally it is defined, the rule of actions and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. This enſuing definition I conceive to be one of the moſt perfect; <hi>Law is a rule of life and of morall actions, made and publiſhed by a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlatour armed with a judiciall power, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding things to be done, and forbidding things that are not to be done, under recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes and penalties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To underſtand the nature of law, we muſt conſider the matter of law, which is, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever can be commanded, whether God or man be the author of it; ſo that no cauſes or things can be exempted from being the matter of the law of God, or of man: it is enough that it may be commanded. The very doctrine and matter of faith may be matter of the law; for the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew <hi>thorah</hi> ſignifieth both law and doctrine: ſo that there is no doubt but that not only the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:123664:43"/> decalogue, but alſo all the doctrine of the Goſpell is matter of the law. For were there any thing that ſhould not be the matter of the law of man, we had need to have a viſible infallible judge on earth, beſides the ſoveraign magiſtrate, who ſhould determine which thing muſt be the matter of the law, which not. The very doctrine of the Trinity is made the matter of the Code of Juſtinian; and Theodoſius commanded that all his ſubjects ſhould embrace the religion that Peter the Apoſtle, Damaſus of Rome, and Peter of Alexandria profeſſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Next we muſt conſider the form of the law, which giveth force of law, and without which law would be no law, and no obedience were due to it in the court of man. That form is the ſtamp or ſanction of the ſoveraign power, obliging men to obey upon penalties. <hi>Law,</hi> ſaith Campanella, <hi>without penalty is no law but counſell.</hi> That form is expreſſed in ſhort in the Digeſts; <hi>Legis virtus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the vertue of the law is to command, to forbid, to permit, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh.</hi> The ſoveraign power giveth the form of law to any matter that is the ſubject of a mans dutie or obedience either to God or man: yea it giveth form to the lawes of God, which though they oblige the conſcience, whether publiſhed or no by the magiſtrate; yet they are of no force in the court of man, to oblige for fear of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, for wrath, except they are commanded by the magiſtrate.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:123664:43"/> So that it is properly man that giveth name and force to a law; and a man may well ſay with St. Auſtin, ep. 66. that Jeſus Chriſt commandeth by the magiſtrate; <hi>hoc jubent Imperatores quod jubet &amp; Chriſtus, quia cum bonum jubent, per illos non jubet niſi Chriſtus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. We muſt conſider the author of the law, either as he that hath given his counſell, and (it may be) furniſhed the matter and contrivance of the law, as Tribonianus to Iuſtinian; or he that hath given ſanction and force of law to the matter brought to him, ſuch was only Juſtinian, and not Tribonianus. Sometimes the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon contrives the law and giveth ſanction to it; ſuch was Solon and Lycurgus. God, who is the author of his lawes, is not the enforcer of them among the Mahumetans, nor any where elſe, without a Moſes; but with thoſe people whom he doth encline to obedience by a law of the ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To the nature of the law it is required, that the legiſlator be armed with a ſword to puniſh the tranſgreſſours of the law; therefore equity, truth and juſtice are no conditions required to the validity of a law, for it receives force from the will of him who is able to make his will good, were it never ſo bad.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is required that the legiſtator ſhould command his own lawes, not anothers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding in his own name, and not in the name
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:123664:44"/> of another; and therefore thoſe that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with judiciall ſoveraign power, are to give account of their actions only to God.</p>
               <p>By what I have ſaid, it is eaſily conceived what force of law have the judgements, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, canons, decrees of eccleſiaſticall judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories, except they receive form and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the magiſtrate; without which they are but counſels, admonitions, and advices.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Touching the matter, they may afford it, as Tribonianus to Iuſtinian: in that ſenſe they may be the authors of a law: but they cannot give form and ſanction to it, obliging men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der penalties in caſe of diſobedience, ſince they are not inveſted with coactive power, without which law is no law; except they have that power in ſubordination to the magiſtrate; for two coordinate powers cannot give ſanction to the ſame law, except it could be imagined, that the will of one ſhould never croſſe the will of the other, which is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Miniſters and church-judicatories are not to command any lawes, much leſſe their own lawes, but only deliver the commands of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, either God or the magiſtrate. The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor may ſay with Moſes Exod. 18. v. 15. <hi>I do make the people know the ſtatutes of God &amp; his lawes;</hi> but he cannot lay any penalty upon the breaker of the law, except, as Moſes, he be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:123664:44"/> with magiſtracy. But were the miniſter not only to deliver the commands of God, but alſo lay a command; this he could not do but in the name of God: and therefore the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate hath this priviledge, that although he be a miniſter of God as well as the miniſter of the Goſpell, yet he may command in his own name the law of God, which the miniſter of the Goſpell may not. It is the opinion of the graveſt Divines, that miniſters have no power of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which being granted, it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they ſhould have a power of juriſdiction: for it was never heard that he that hath no power of (or capacity to) legiſlation, can have any to juriſdiction; for every member of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament is ſuppoſed to be capable of exerciſing juriſdiction, but were he diſinabled to have a power of legiſlation, by that he ſhould looſe all capacity to bear any office of juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Camero is very expreſſe in his tract <hi>de Eccleſia</hi> p. 369. where having ſhewed that there be two things which are the matter of law, 1. faith and good manners, 2. things that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to order and diſcipline; he addes, <hi>in nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind the church hath power to make lawes:</hi> having ſaid a little before that <hi>what proceedeth from the church ought rather to be called admonitions and exhortations, then lawes.</hi> Muſculus is no leſſe expreſſe in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon places p. 6<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This ſheweth the invalidity of all canons, decrees and ſentences of church-judicatories; which except they be known to be equitable, true and juſt, are not to be obeyed: ſince the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity of an eccleſiaſticall law is not like that of the magiſtrates, which be it never ſo unjuſt, hath the force of a law: but ſure none of our preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian brethren will maintain, that all judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſentences of church-judicatories are infallible; and therefore it belongeth to every man cenſured by ſuch a judicatorie, to be well informed of the juſtice, truth and equity of the cenſure, before he obeyeth it, yea before it hath the force or name of a cenſure. For it fares with the ſentences of miniſters, as with the counſels of phyſitians, which muſt convince the party of the neceſſity of vielding to this or that remedy: their commands muſt have alwayes ſome reaſon annexed, why they muſt be obeyed: but the law of the magiſtrate needs none, and permits none to interpret it, but obey it accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the letter.</p>
               <p>Lawes are variouſly divided: into Divine and humane; eccleſiaſticall and civil; morall, cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:123664:45"/> and politick. Some call thoſe divine, which are made by God; and thoſe humane, which are made by men: others call them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine lawes, which rule the conſcience; and thoſe humane laws, which govern the outward man. But none of theſe diviſions are without their defects: for humane lawes govern and oblige the conſcience, as the Apoſtle tells us Ro. 13. and albeit all humane lawes are not divine, yet all divine lawes are ſo far humane, as the magiſtrate giveth a ſanction to them, and impoſeth an obligation in the court of man to obey them.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe the diviſion of lawes into morall, policick and ceremoniall, hath its defects: for I conceive that the morall law is the ground and baſis of the ceremoniall and politick, and a rule by which God is to be worſhipped, State, cities, families, fathers, husbands, children, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants muſt be governed. So that the ceremoniall law is but the morall law applied to the uſe of divine worſhip; and the politick or civil law is but the morall law applyable to the practiſe and converſation of life at home and abroad.</p>
               <p>The holy Scripture putteth no ſuch diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. 1. God was alike the author of them all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God only and Moſes his deputy on earth did give a ſanction and ſtamp of obligation to them all.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The matter indeed was diverſe; and ſo are
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:123664:46"/> the military lawes diſtinct from the matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall and teſtamentary, and yet are they all comprehended under the civil law, becauſe the civil magiſtrate giveth force of law to them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: upon that account why may not the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and ceremoniall law be called civil?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe when the Scripture ſpeaketh of the perfection of the law of God, of thoſe that walk in the lawes of God, that the law of Moſes was read every Sabbath, that many dayes paſſed without law; the whole body of the lawes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by Moſes is underſtood, without any ſuch partition.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Becauſe the ſame perſons judged every cauſes and matter puniſhable by the law, there being, as Mr. Gilleſpie faineth, no ſuch thing as a judicatory eccleſiaſticall for eccleſiaſticall cauſes &amp; a civil bench where the judges decided civil or politick cauſes; for ſo we ſhould need a third bench of judges medling with morall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and cauſes. Yet Mr. Gilleſpie, p. 14. grants that the Jewes had no other civil law but Gods own law; and beſides that the Levites judged not only in the buſineſſe of the Lord, but alſo in the buſineſſe of the King, 1 Chron. 2. v. 30. &amp; 32.</p>
               <p>And ſo falls down the diviſion of lawes into eccleſiaſticall and civil; for</p>
               <p n="1">1. They differ not in kind, otherwiſe then a man from an animall; this being the <hi>genus,</hi> the other the <hi>ſpecies.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:123664:46"/>
               <p n="2">2. All lawes deviſed by men, whatever ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and matter they are about, are civil, poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, and lawes of that power that giveth them force and vigour of lawes: ſuch are all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions about diſcipline of the church, which in vain they call eccleſiaſticall.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If a law were to be called eccleſiaſticall, becauſe it handleth lawes for the government of the church, we ſhould need as many kinds of lawes as there be ſocieties in the world, and we ſhould have one peculiar claſſis for lawes to govern ſchools and Univerſities, another to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern ſocieties of merchants, a third for ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties of drapers. I do not deny but that a law may be as properly called eccleſiaſticall, as a law is called nauticall, military, teſtamentary, matrimoniall, either becauſe they are about matters of churches, armies, wills, husbands, wives; or becauſe they were invented for the benefit of churches, ſouldiers, married people, and the like: but in vain do they think to call a law eccleſiaſticall becauſe not only it is of church-matters, but alſo becauſe it muſt be made by eccleſiaſticall men, and receive form and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from them, and becauſe all cauſes &amp; mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which they call eccleſiaſticall muſt be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by eccleſiaſticall men. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. As eccleſiaſticall power (if there be any ſuch thing) muſt be ſubordinate to the civil, as we have proved before; ſo eccleſiaſticall lawes to the civil lawes.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Miniſters having no power of legiſlation nor of juriſdiction; therefore lawes to govern Chriſtians in churches need not to take their name from church, miniſter or miniſtery, but from the magiſtrate, who is the maker, latour and giver of them, and binds men to a ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them under penalty.</p>
               <p>Muſculus, in the above-quoted place, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth at large this diviſion of lawes into ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and eccleſiaſticall, and tells us, how far lawes are to be called eccleſiaſticall, though they be in truth the magiſtrates lawes; only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are made by him for the good of the church: for as properly, ſaith he, lawes may be called ſcholaſticall and Academicall, becauſe they were made for the good and benefit of ſchools or Univerſities; and ſo far, and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, can it be allowed that lawes ſhould be ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the nature of judgement: what judgement every private man hath, what the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and what miniſters, ſynods and church-judicatories. They have no defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive judgement, as Mr. Rutherfurd aſſerts; but the magiſtrate hath the greateſt ſhare in de finitive judgements: which is proved
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:123664:47"/> by ſome paſſages of Mr. Rutherfurd, and of Pareus and Rivetus. Who is the judge of controverſies?</p>
               </argument>
               <p>NOt to run over all the acceptions of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which I have handled in my <hi>Parae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis,</hi> I will mention but one, that ſerveth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the whole controverſie, which lieth in a narrow room, whether the magiſtrate, or paſtors aſſembled in a presbytery and ſynod, or even private men be judges of controverſies about faith and diſcipline.</p>
               <p>Iudgement is an act, by which every man endowed with reaſon, or pretending to have any, upon debating within himſelf, and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things to be done or to be believed, at length reſolveth peremptorily what either he will do himſelf, or will have others to do, about things he conceiveth to be true, juſt and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. For to the nature of judgement it is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, that the thing that a man will do him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or will have others to do, be true, juſt and good; it being enough that he apprehendeth them to be ſo.</p>
               <p>I make two judgements; one private, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther publick. The private I call judgement of diſcretion, by which every one having weighed and debated within himſelf the truth, equity, goodneſſe or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſefulneſſe of counſels, advices, commands, doctrine and perſons, at length choſeth and pitcheth rather upon this then that:
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:123664:48"/> this judgement may be called judgement of knowledge and apprehenſion.</p>
               <p>The publick judgement is the delivery of ones private judgement ſo far as concerneth others, by which a man uttereth what he conceiveth fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for others to do or believe.</p>
               <p>This judgement in miniſters, presbyteries, ſynods, wiſe men, counſellors, phyſitians and others not inveſted with any juriſdiction, and who have more authority then power, is called advice, counſell, declaration, when they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their ſenſe, meaning and opinion upon any debated ſubject, concluding ſomething which they conceive others are to embrace, believe or practiſe.</p>
               <p>In magiſtrates and men inveſted with juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, both this publick judgement and the private have the ſame operation; as in miniſters, ſynods, counſellors and the like: but over and above it cauſeth them to command what they conceived fitting to be received and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed.</p>
               <p>By the publick judgement Paſtors do what St. Auſtin ſaith, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 48. to Vincentius; <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storis eſt perſuadere ad veritatem perſuaden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do; paſtors are to bring to truth by perſuaſion: ſed magiſtratus eſt cogendo; but magiſtrates are to bring to it by conſtraint and by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From theſe publick judgements every private man is to appeal to his private judgement of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:123664:48"/> diſcretion; not yielding and giving his aſſent to the declarations, canons, ſentences of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, any further then by his judgement of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he conceiveth them to be true, juſt and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; not obeying actively the commands of the magiſtrate, in caſe he conceiveth them, by the ſame judgement of diſcretion, to be againſt faith and good manners.</p>
               <p>The ſtaring thus and dividing of judgement decideth, as I conceive, all the queſtions and doubts ariſing about this ſubject, and anſwereth all Mr. R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>therfurds and Gilleſpies definitions and objections concerning judgement.</p>
               <p>They make a fourfold judgement; apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, diſcretive, definitive, and infallible, which belongeth only to Jeſus Chriſt. The definitive, they ſay, is proper to miniſters and church-judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories. But they forget the main judgement, which giveth life and force to all the reſt, and is the magiſtrates, when he bringeth to execution things well debated by the judgement of decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and approved of by the judgement of diſcretion.</p>
               <p>In that diviſion of theirs they alſo commit two great errors. 1. That they make of one judgement two; for to the judgement of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they adde a judgement of apprehenſion, which differs only in degrees from the other; and were theſe judgements diſtinct, yet they go alwaies together, and are alwaies in the ſame perſon, and do belong to the private judgement.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:123664:49"/> 2. They aſcribe a definitive judgement to paſtors and church-judicatories, which they themſelves had need to explain what they mean by: for, 1. muſt every private man ſtand to it, and not appeal from it to his judgement of diſcretion? 2. if they do not ſtand to it, what inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, harm or danger, or worſe conſequence can befall him, then any one that deſpiſeth good counſell or advice, which put no obligation, except they be reduced into lawes and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands by the magiſtrate? 3. muſt the magiſtrate adhere to that definitive judgement, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them without debating within himſelf whether thoſe definitions be agreable with his own publick or private judgement? which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is to make of him an executioner. If he muſt not ſtand to the definitions of paſtors and ſynods, but rather they muſt ſtand to what he conceiveth moſt fitting; then it is evident that that judgement of paſtors, called by them defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive, is of no validity, and hath need to take another name, ſince neither magiſtrate nor pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men are obliged to ſtand to it, except they be convinced that it is reaſonable, and that its definitions are true, juſt and uſefull.</p>
               <p>The evidence of this truth about judgement is ſo clear, that Mr. Rutherfurd and Gilleſpie are unwares carried ſometimes to deliver the ſubſtance of what we ſaid before. I will alledge but two paſſages out of Mr. Rutherfurds book, of the divine right of church-government; for
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:123664:49"/> there he overthroweth his definitive judgement of paſtors or church-judicatories, and ſetteth above it not only the judgement of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, but alſo that of every private man: for ſure, that definitive judgement that may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed and rejected without any redreſſe by the miniſters, cannot be of any weight or vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</p>
               <p>The firſt paſſage is ch. 25. queſt. 21. p. 668. <hi>The magiſtrate is not more tyed to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a ſynod or church, then any private man is tyed to his practiſe. The tye in diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and in all ſynodicall acts and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is here as it is in preaching the word: the tye is ſecondary, conditionall, with limitation, ſo far forth as it agreeth with the word; not abſolutely obliging, not Papal qua, nor becauſe commanded, or becauſe determined by the church; and ſuch as magiſtrates and all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians may reject, when contrary to or not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the word of God.</hi> If ſuch words had faln from Grotius or Mr. Coleman, they would have been branded for rank Eraſtianiſme. If all the presbyterians will but put their names with <hi>probatum est</hi> to them, all controverſie will be ended, and the power in the hands of church-officers will be no longer diſtinct from that of the magiſtrate, and all presbyterian juriſdiction of excommunicating, depoſing, and making lawes authoritatively, will be taken away. So that, if we give credit to Mr. Rutherfurd, all acts,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:123664:50"/> ſentences and excommunications pronounced by ſynods and presbyteries, are no further va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide, then as they are conceived by the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and private men agreeable with the word.</p>
               <p>The other paſſage of Mr. Rutherfurd doth no leſſe pull down the definitive judgement of miniſters, and by it all presbyterian juriſdiction; p. 577. <hi>As the church is to approve and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the juſt ſentence of the civill judge in puniſhing ill doers; but only conditionally, ſo far as it is just: ſo is the magiſtrate obliged to follow, ratifie, and with his civil ſanction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the ſound constitutions of the church, but conditionally; not abſolutely and blindly, but only ſo far as they agree with the word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Studying brevity, I am loth to load the reader with authorities out of moſt eminent divines, Zanchius, Martyr, Iunius, Pareus, Camero, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetus, and others; all jointly proving, 1. that all the judgements and ſentences of ſynods, church-judicatories, presbyteries, are mere counſels, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and no lawes obliging to obedience or to aſſent, except they receive the ultimate ſanction from the magiſtrate; 2. that the magiſtrate ought not to take the miniſters or ſynods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment barely becauſe it comes from them, but follow his own judgement. I will alledge but one or two out of Pareus, and one out of Rive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:123664:50"/>
               <p>That of Pareus is on the 13. Rom. <hi>All faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, even private men, ought to judge of faith and of religion; not only with an apprehenſive judgement, that by it they may understand the true religion; but alſo with a judgement of diſcretion, that they may diſtinguiſh the true from the falſe, hold to one and reject the other: much more ought the Chriſtian magiſtrate to judge of the religion, not only apprehenſively and diſcretively, but alſo definitively.</hi> Here we have a definitive judgement proper to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates as well as to miniſters and church-ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories. In the ſame place; <hi>A Prince ought to defend the true religion, ſuppreſſe the falſe, baniſh blaſphemies and hereſies: he ought then to know of all theſe ſingly, and by his office judge of them: for if he were only to draw the ſword at the beck of the priests, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and judgement, and without making any question whether the judgements of the paſtors are right or no; what would he be but a ſergeant and an executioner, as the Iewes made of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, ſaving to him, If he had not been a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour, we would not have delivered him to thee?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Rivet on the decalogue hath theſe words: <hi>We joyn thoſe two together: that the magiſtrate ſhould not only act by others prejudice, but alſo by his own judgement; not that he ſhould trust ſo much to his, but alſo let miniſters of the Goſpell have their parts; not relying on his
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:123664:51"/> fancy, but being counſelled by the pastors of churches, calling ſynods, and there hearing godly and learned men diſcourſing out of the word of God, of controverſies of religion, and of articles of faith; then what he hath himſelf approved of to be the truth, let him embrace it and ſpread it.</hi> There he maketh no more of ſynods, then a Prince of his ſtate-counſellors, or a ſick man of his phyſitians, whoſe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they take for counſells and advices, and not for definitive ſentences. And ſo ſpeaketh Mareſius <hi>Coll. Theol. loc.</hi> 16. <hi>theſ.</hi> 77. <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of churches do not ſo much repreſent judges in a ſenat, as prudent doctors and learned, gathered to give counſell; and their reſult is like the advice of phyſitians about the health of the body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By what I have ſaid of judgement, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged out of Mr. Rutherfurd, that queſtion ſo much debated betwixt the Romaniſts and the Proteſtants, who is the judge of controverſies in matters of faith, is eaſily decided: for doubtleſſe the miniſters of the Goſpell have by their educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, function and miniſteriall duty, that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick judgement to declare either in churches or ſynods, what by the judgement of diſcretion they conceive to be the mind and the ordinance of Chriſt; but this judgement inforceth and obligeth no man to aſſent to it, except they alſo by their private judgement of diſcretion appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it to be ſuch. So ought neither magiſtrates,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:123664:51"/> nor the power of magiſtracy ſeated in churches, to command or enjoyn it as a law to be obeyed, or a doctrine to be believed, except apprehended by the judgement of diſcretion to be the mind or an ordinance of Chriſt. Miniſters in divinity, phyſitians in phyſick, each profeſſour of art in his art, not only becauſe they are more verſed in that thing they profeſſe, but alſo <hi>ex officio,</hi> have a judgement that carrieth and giveth more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; but it being fallible, and therefore ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the reviſall of others, whether magiſtrates or ſubjects, and not attended with command obliging to obedience, either active or paſſive, it is only authentick to them that are perſwaded and convinced to yield to it.</p>

Had the Lord Jeſus Chriſt inſtituted a juriſdiction diſtinct and independent from the magiſtrate, they were to diſclaim that ordinance which delegated a power which was none of their own, but was derived immediatly from Chriſt, not by the intervention and the chanell of the magiſtrate, unto themſelves as miniſters
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:123664:53"/> of Chriſt: and if any ordinance before their ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was to be expected, it was not to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the miniſters, but to the people, who were to be enjoyned to ſuffer the miniſters to exerciſe that juriſdiction which they authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively challenge from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Had the juriſdiction of the Aſſembly been acknowledged, the magiſtrate, as our brethren the Scots ſpeak, ſhould have ſubmitted to all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions of the Aſſembly, being no longer hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble advices, but canons, decrees and lawes made authoritatively, by the Governours of churches under Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But what ſenſe can be given to theſe words, when they ſay, there is a government diſtinct from the magiſtrate? Is it ſuch a diſtinction as is betwixt ſubordinates, or betwixt coordinates? If the magiſtrates power and the presbyterian power are coordinates, each muſt needs be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent one from the other; which how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent it is under one magiſtrate, we have diſcuſſed in another place. If theſe powers be ſubordinate, it muſt be one of theſe three wayes: 1. in coercive power; 2. in judgement or judiciall determinations, that are to paſſe for lawes, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging all ſorts of people to obedience either active or paſſive: 3. in the affinity of power in nature and definition, which neceſſarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports ſubordination betwixt them. 1. For mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of coercive power, the eccleſiaſticall having none, they muſt be beholden to another power,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:123664:53"/> which indeed makes it to be power; all externall power and juriſdiction being but childrens play, <hi>ens rationis,</hi> a bubble, a name without a thing, without a power of coercion. 2. For judgement; if eccleſiaſticall men cannot exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their power without the magiſtrate, the queſtion will be whether he ſhall execute their injunctions as a judge and interpreter, or as a ſergeant and executioner, not interpreting the commands of the court, but fulfilling them with a blind obedience and judgement: for there is no <hi>medium</hi> betwixt theſe two. If as a judge, then he ought to judge of the judgements of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, ere he doth command them to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; and ſo in a manner all determinations of miniſters will be but counſels and advices, ſeeing before they have force of law and of rule, they muſt receive the ultimate judgement and approbation from the magiſtrate. 3. Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of powers implieth affinity of definition and nature betwixt the ſubordinates: as Surgerie being ſubordinate to Medicine, proveth the affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity betwixt Medicine and Surgery. Yea, if ſubordinate juriſdictions ſtand in <hi>pari gradu,</hi> and in equall diſtance from the power they are ſubordinate unto, it argueth an identity of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictions among them: as if the juriſdiction of a colledge of phyſitians and of a corporation of merchants be both ſubordinate to one magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, it is manifeſt that the juriſdiction of that colledge and of that corporation are but one, as
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:123664:54"/> ſpringing from one head of juriſdiction; thus if the juriſdictions of a church and of a corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are of equall diſtance in ſubordination from one ſpring-head of juriſdiction, no doubt the juriſdiction of that church and of that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration are but one juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>Now that the nature of the juriſdiction of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, churches and ſynods, is the ſame with that of magiſtracy, &amp; needeth not to be coordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate with it, it is evident by many proofs.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is the ſame uſe of judgement, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and diſcretion: as by the ſame yard one may meaſure cloth, ſilk and thred; ſo may the ſame wiſe politicall head, and the ſame pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and diſcretion govern a ſtate, a church, and a family. Dionyſius the tyrant uſed to ſay, he did employ the ſame art in governing his ſchool at Corinth, and his Kingdom of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is the ſame nature of law in both juriſdictions: for the nature of the law conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth not in its being juſt, equall and honeſt; but in its being publiſhed by him or them that are inveſted with magiſtracy. The better men, (that is, not the wiſer and the moſt rationall, but the richer and the moſt potent) give law to the reſt. The philoſophers permit us to weigh and interpret their lawes; but the magiſtrate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth blind obedience to his. Seneca ſaith that the magiſtrates law doth not diſpute, but commandeth: and Tullie in his th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:123664:54"/> natura Deorum ſaith, <hi>I am to receive from thee, O philoſopher, ſatisfaction from reaſon; but I am to yield to the lawes that our ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours have delivered us, though they give no reaſon.</hi> In like manner all presbyterian ſynods, namely the generall aſſembly of Scotland, do not give ſo much leave to inferiour eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call judicatories or private perſons, to examine their decrees by a judgement of diſcretion, as thoſe of Beroea took to themſelves when they examined St. Pauls doctrine, and ſearched the Scripture, to know whether it was ſo as he preached: for their eccleſiaſticall conſtitutions have force of law, only becauſe they have the ſanction of an eccleſiaſticall aſſembly, and are not to be diſputed by any inferiour judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; whereas the nature of an eccleſiaſticall law ſhould be quite different from the civil, <hi>viz.</hi> that it ſhould not be the product of a juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on compelling or requiring to aſſent or obey, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the inward man be perſwaded and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced. It may be our presbyterian brethren will ſay that, for example, excommunication hath no further validity of ſentence, then as it is juſt, and done deſervedly: which indeed proves the nullity of all excommunications; for all being done in the name of Chriſt, all muſt needs be juſt and valid, and every one excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the name of Chriſt ſhould excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate infallibly, and his excommunication ſhould be an effect of an unerring judgement; which
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:123664:55"/> till it be known to be infallible, a man may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly queſtion the validity of his excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In this alſo there is a great affinity and agreement betwixt the juriſdiction they call ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall, and the civil (and therefore no need to make two of one;) that eccleſiaſticall preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian juriſdiction is bounded by the ſame li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits as is the civill juriſdiction, which is againſt the nature of all other juriſdictions different from the magiſtrates power, though ſubordinate to it, as is the maritall and paternall powers; none doubting but a father in England hath a power over his ſon in France, and that a wife is ſubject to her husband however diſtant from him. Now it is granted by all, that the juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of churches combined, and that of ſynods never went beyond the magiſtrates juriſdiction; that the churches of Perſia, Aethiopia and India were not tyed to obſerve the deciees of the firſt councill of Nice, nor the reformed churches of France thoſe of the ſynod of Dordrecht, neither the church of Barwick to ſubmit to the orders of the generall aſſembly of Scotland: and yet ſome do not ſtick to maintain, that a man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated in Scotland, is alſo bound by the ſame ſentence in France or Holland, becauſe, if we may believe them, it is reaſonable that the ſphear of activity within which excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion acteth ſhould as much ſpread down wards as upwards; and that ſince a man bound by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:123664:55"/> at Edenburgh is alſo tyed in heaven, good reaſon he ſhould be bound and faſt in any part of the earth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This alſo which all churches, claſſes and ſynods aſſume, makes their juriſdiction wholly concurring in nature and property with the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the magiſtrate; which is, that as in all civil and politicall aſſemblies, the major and the ſtronger part in votes, not in reaſons, doth carry it; ſo decrees and canons, becauſe the major part have voted them to be ſuch, are therefore receivable by inferiour eccleſiaſticall judicatories, as they call them: whereas, ſince they pretend that eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction is of a quite different nature from that of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, it were moſt convenient that it ſhould not be like it in this main particular, but that private men or churches ſhould adhere to truth, not to multitude; not numbring the votes, but weighing the reaſons.</p>
               <p>And indeed this was well conſidered by the Parliament, in their ordinance for calling of the aſſembly: for though they took upon themſelves that power of legiſlation &amp; juriſdiction, whoſe votes are not weighed, but numbred, and which cannot be otherwiſe exerciſed in this world; yet they very prudently conceived, that ſuch a juriſdiction could not be aſſumed by church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as ſuch, in matters of religion: for they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intended, that whatſoever ſhould be tranſacted or defined by the major part of the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:123664:56"/> miniſters of the Aſſembly, ſhould be received for a canon and an eccleſiaſticall law, that ſhould ſtand in force; ſince they expreſſely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn, in the rules which they preſcribed to the aſſembly, 1. that their deciſions and definitions ſhould be preſented to the Parliament, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of law made to them, but of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble advice; 2. that no regard ſhould be had to the number of the perſons diſſenting or aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but that each party ſhould ſubſcribe their names to their opinion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another argument to prove that the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall and the magiſtrates power are not coordinate, but that the eccleſiaſticall is ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to that of the magiſtrate, and that they both are of the ſame nature, is, that both of them, magiſtrate and miniſters, challenge not only the duty of meſſengers from God, in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering to the people the lawes of God; but alſo as judges exerciſe power about making new lawes, which do oblige to obedience for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ſake: for the aſſemblies &amp; presbyteries of Scotland do not only preſſe obedience to the lawes expreſſely ſet down in Scripture, but alſo to their canons, decrees and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Another argument to prove the identity of the powers eccleſiaſticall and civil is, that both are converſant about lawes and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are made by men: ſuch are moſt of the canons and conſtitutions of ſynods and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:123664:56"/> eccleſiaſticall aſſemblies, which are no more expreſſe Scripture then the Inſtinian Code: and therefore it is altogether needleſſe to conſtitute two coordinate humane legiſlative powers.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But ſuppoſe that all the decrees, canons, conſtitutions of presbyteries and church-aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies were word of God, and divine precepts, this very thing, that they are divine conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that one juriſdiction or other muſt be conceived enjoyning by a ſanction, and commanding obedience to them, argueth that eccleſiaſticall and civil juriſdiction are but one: For what can the eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction do more, then to give a ſanction to the lawes of God? which thing the magiſtrate is to do. If he muſt give a ſanction to the decalogue, why not to all other precepts which are equally of divine inſtitution?</p>
               <p n="8">8. It is abſurd to put under the Goſpell a difference betwixt the juriſdiction or law of Chriſt, and the law of God the univerſall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, as Mr. Gilleſpie ſpeaketh p. 261. for there is no precept of the decalogue, there is nothing good, holy, honeſt and of good report, but is the law of Jeſus Chriſt: and therefore ſince the magiſtrate cannot be <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, a miniſter of God, as St. Paul calls him, but he muſt be a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Jeſus Chriſt, and that he cannot be keeper of the decalogue and of the law of God under Moſes adminiſtration, but he muſt be alſo the keeper of the law of Chriſt; what need
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:123664:57"/> to conſtitute two coordinate judiciall powers, each of them being <hi>pari gradu</hi> ſubordinate to Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, if the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt is not of this world, and that this Kingdom, as our brethren tell us, is the presbyterian govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then this Kingdom muſt have a juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and lawes quite different from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and juriſdiction of this world; which yet doth not prove true by the parallels we have made of both juriſdictions.</p>
               <p>Mr. Gilleſpie, a member of that Aſſembly, pag. 85. endeavoureth to ſhew what a wide difference there is betwixt theſe two juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, in their nature, cauſes, objects, adjuncts: but I might upon the ſame grounds maintain the like wide difference betwixt martiall, navall, teſtamentall, paternall, maritall and civil power; all differing, and yet ſubordinate to that of the magiſtrate. I might alſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to each ſociety its peculiar power; pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in a colledge of phyſicians a medicall power, ſubordinate to God the God of bodies, health and outward ſafety, as the civil is ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to the God of the Univerſe, and the eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall to Chriſt. For if the God of nations hath inſtituted the civil power, and the God of ſaints the eccleſiaſticall, as Mr. Gilleſpie ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; what hinders but that the God of nature hath inſtituted the medicall power? And if mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall good be the object of the civil power, and

               <p>WE proceed to examine what the Rever. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly ſay, that Jeſus Chriſt hath inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted this eccleſiaſticall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ſdiction as King and head of his Church. Mr. Gilleſpie, one of their body, and therefore the beſt interpreter of their meaning, ſaith in his 2. book chap. 5. that Jeſus Chriſt hath two Kingdoms: 1. a generall, as he is the eternall Son of God, the head of all principalities &amp; powers, raigning over all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; 2. a particular Kingdom, as he is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, raigning over the church only: by which church he underſtandeth a viſible church of ſaints, combined in ſuch a body as is the church of Scotland, enjoying the ordinances and the diſcipline of Chriſt. And of this Kingdom he underſtandeth Matth. 16. v. 28. <hi>There be ſome standing here, which ſhall not taſte of death, till they ſee the Son of man coming in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:123664:58"/> So doth Beza againſt Eraſtus, who, with Mr. Gilleſpie, out of thoſe words of Chriſt, <hi>my Kingdom is not of this world,</hi> concludeth two things: 1. that the eccleſiaſticall government is diſtinct from the civill or that of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate; 2. that that Kingdom is an aggregation of many churches under one presbytery.</p>
               <p>In the 6. chap. of the ſame book he is very prolix to prove, that Jeſus Chriſt, as mediatour and head of the Church, hath not appointed the magiſtrate to be his viceregent in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the church in the ſecond accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe that the holy Scripture mentioneth two Kingdoms; but that both theſe be viſible ones, I deny flatly: particularly, that Jeſus Chriſt is called King and head of the church, in reference to the viſible congregations of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, or that by the body of Chriſt is meant the viſible aſſembly of thoſe that make outward profeſſion of the Chriſtian religion.</p>
               <p>Let us then conſider in this Kingdom of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt as mediatour, the nature of the King and head, of his ſcepter, ſword, power, weapons, keyes, fullneſſe; that ſo we may ſee if all theſe qualifications, yea if any one of theſe are proper to any viſible church particular and nationall.</p>
               <p>Both Rivet and Reynolds, in their comments upon the 110. Pſalme, make this Kingdom wholly ſpirituall, not of this world, much leſſe
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:123664:58"/> ſeen in this world, though known to be in this world. It is that Kingdom which is many times mentioned in the Goſpell; but never once taken for a viſible government of men profeſſing out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly the name of Chriſt, but for the Kingdom of grace, and that government which Chriſt hath over thoſe whom he ruleth by his ſpirit of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>option. The keyes of this Kingdom are the door of utterance in the miniſtery, whereby men have entrance: theſe keyes keep out from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thoſe that are without doors, but never put out any that are once in; and therefore moſt abſurd it is to ground the power of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation upon the power of the keyes, committed by Jeſus Chriſt to the Apoſtles: if the Kingdom of which Chriſt ſpeaketh is the Kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or of grace, will they ſay that an excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated perſon is put o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the Kingdom of grace? The ſcepter and ſword of this Kingdom is the word of God. The weapons are not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; nor are they uſed to the putting a man out by excommunication: but to the pulling down the ſtrong holds of ſin; not by tying a man with church-cenſures, but bringing into capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity his imaginations to the obedience of Chriſt. This truth broke through the darkneſſe of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, and was acknowledged by thoſe that were oppreſſed by the Popes tyrannie: ſo in the year 1080. the advocate of the Emperour <hi>confut.</hi> 9. ſaith, <hi>that the preaching of Gregory the</hi> 7. <hi>was new, ſince the church had no other ſword then
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:123664:59"/> that of the ſpirit, which was the word of God.</hi> This language was acknowledged by the cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts to be in the mouths of the Popes adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, who yet kept within the communion of Rome, never dreaming of a Wicleff or a Luther; as <hi>can.</hi> inter. 33. queſt. 3. <hi>Eccleſia non habet gladium niſi ſpiritualem, qui non occidit, ſed viviſificat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The law of this Kingdom is not the diſcipline or cenſure of the church, but the law both of the Goſpell and of faith, called alſo the law of the ſpirit. For by the power of that Kingdom, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the holy Ghoſt in the new Teſtament, and mentioned in 50. places, is not in any of them underſtood the eccleſiaſticall power, or any ſuch thing as the power of miniſters, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries, ſynods, to make decrees, canons, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine authoritatively, to ſuſpend, excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate and abſolve: but alwayes is meant that power that tranſlateth from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of ſatan unto God; by which we are made ſons of God, Ioh. 1. v. 12. by which we are enlightened, Act. 26. v. 18. and raiſed unto newneſſe of life.</p>
               <p>The fullneſſe of that Kingdom is, the ſaving gifts and graces given to the members. The head of this Kingdom is Jeſus Chriſt, our King, Prieſt and Prophet, ruling by his ſpirit his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which are his members, offering, ſatisfying and interceding only for them, teaching none ſavingly but them.</p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:123664:59"/>
               <p>There is no governour or viceregent of this church, but the ſpirit of God working in the heart by the word preached or read, and guiding into all truth. Though God hath no viſible go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of this Kingdom, yet he hath exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally many ſubſervient inſtruments and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters for the advancing of that Kingdom; as magiſtrates by their juriſdiction, paſtors by their function, all godly people by their generall calling and dutie, their perſecutions, afflictions, maladies; and particularly the miniſters of the Goſpell are main agents in Gods hands for the building up of that Kingdom. What they know they do, is the leaſt part of their miniſtery; they themſelves being ignorant, what and how they work by it in mens hearts. Gods chief miniſter is Chriſt in the word: the power is the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious working of the word: the keyes are the openings of the heart to the word, or rather the openings of the word to the heart, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the perſon into the heavenly fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p>This power is not placed in the miniſters, but the word; which though it is delivered by them not only in a way of beſeeching and exhorting, but alſo of commanding, yet that juriſdiction is only effectuall on thoſe that of unwilling are rendred willing: ſo that it is rather the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the word, then of the miniſter: for the miniſters operation in the miniſtery is like to that of the artiſts in their chymicall opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:123664:60"/> where they are rather ſpectators then actors, <hi>admovendo agentia paſſivis;</hi> for nature and fire are the main agents. They are like an husbandman in a vintage, who maketh not the wine, but ordereth it, powring it from one veſſel to another.</p>
               <p>This being the nature of the Kingdom and church of God, of which Chriſt is the head and King; it remaineth to enquire, who is the vicere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of God, in governing the viſible congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of Chriſtians meeting about the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God.</p>
               <p>Properly the magiſtrate is not head of the church, more then of other ſocieties: for as the callings of a phyſitian, merchant, ſmith, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſo of a Chriſtian, as Chriſtian and church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, are not ſubordinate to magiſtracy; but only under the notion of, and as they are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of families, ſocieties, corporations and commonwealths: in all which magiſtracy is virtually and eminently reſident; in regard that no ſociety of men can be imagined to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned either without a power delegate from the magiſtrate, or without aſſuming magiſtracy within it ſelf.</p>
               <p>In that ſenſe the magiſtrate may be ſaid, for theſe three or four reaſons, to be head of a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nationall church. 1. Becauſe the matter, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and extent of the power exerciſed by that church, being wholly the ſame with that of the magiſtrate, it is needleſſe to make of one power
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:123664:60"/> two; and therefore the magiſtrate being the ſupreme governour in the managing of that power exerciſed alike in all kinds of ſocieties within his dominion, he may very properly be the ſupreme governour as well of churches, as of all other ſocieties.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The magiſtrate may be ſaid to be head of the viſible church, becauſe there is no man, of what place, function, calling, dignity ſo ever he be, that in an externall viſible way can ſo much promote the intereſt of Jeſus Chriſt, and the building up of his Kingdom, as the ſupreme magiſtrate; not ſo much conſidered as Chriſtian, but as magiſtrate, and by vertue of his magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy. None doth doubt but that one ſingle woman, namely Queen Elizabeth, being a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, did contribute more for eſtabliſhing and ſpreading the Goſpell of Chriſt in England, then all the godly miniſters put together in the dayes of Queen Mary.</p>
               <p>Let but one ſingle magiſtrate countenance religion, this will avail more then thouſands of Greenhams or Bradfords under a magiſtrate of a contrary religion. Sure, where God hath given more ability and power to do good, he alſo hath placed there more right &amp; duty to promote that good. I think there was more ſtreſſe of duty laid upon Queen Elizabeth to advance Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in England, then on 100. Bradfords, Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers and Ridleys in Queen Maries dayes.</p>
               <p>A 3. ground may be added, why the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:123664:61"/> magiſtrate may be called the head of the church, (and which is much preſſed by Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds, Martyr, Muſculus, Bullingerus, Gual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terus, Zanchius, Pareus,) is, becauſe all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions of miniſters about matters of faith or diſcipline, are but mere counſels, advices and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections; not binding externally, that is actively or paſſively, any church, ſociety or corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, except they receive a ſanction from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate: and beſides that theſe ſanctions are not to be made by him <hi>caeco judicio,</hi> with a blind judgement, ſtanding to their determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without examination, and doing as much as thoſe of Beroea, who ere they believed St. Paul, ſearched the Scriptures, to know whether it was ſo as he preached. As no obedience is to be rendred by any perſon, ſociety or corporation, without they duly weigh in their judgement of diſcretion whether the command be juſt or no: ſo a command is not to be made by the perſon whoſe duty and part it is to command, untill he firſt underſtandeth and apprehendeth by his judgement of diſcretion the thing to be a good and a fitting rule of obedience. So that ſince presbyteries and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ynods cannot enforce obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of obedience to their declarations and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions, without the injunction and command of the magiſtrate; ſince alſo he is not to enjoin or command any thing repugnant to his own judgement; it doth conſequently follow, that good reaſon it is, that he who laſt is to judge
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:123664:61"/> and command any thing, propounded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated in whatever aſſembly of men, ſhould be ſtiled the ſovereign judge, head, ruler, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of thoſe things that are ſolely in his own power.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he may be ſaid to be head of the church, becauſe of three main duties which are annexed to his office of magiſtracy, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend what is requiſite for life, godlineſſe and happineſſe. The 1. is <hi>proviſio mediorum conducentium ad finem optimum,</hi> proviſion of the means conducing to the beſt end: 2. <hi>remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio impedientium,</hi> the removing of hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances: 3. <hi>actualis directio in illum finem,</hi> an actuall direction &amp; ordering things to that end.</p>
               <p>Theſe 3. conditions Javellus a Romiſh Biſhop layes down to aſſert the ſoveraign power of the magiſtrate, in judging, providing, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, and removing, in order to obtaining the beſt end, which he ſaith is the main felicity of man.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, he may be well called head of the church, that receiveth appeals from all church-judicatories, and diſannuls or ratifies their judgements and ſentences. But Mr. Rutherfurd denieth thoſe acts to be appeals, being not <hi>in eadem ſerie,</hi> from a lower eccleſiaſticall court to a ſuperiour eccleſiaſticall court; and ſaith, that from an eccleſiaſticall court to a civil, as to the magiſtrate, there is no appeal, but a removall by a declinator, a complaint, a refuge. But we
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:123664:62"/> having proved that ſynods, presbyteries, &amp;c. have no juriſdiction but what they have from the magiſtrate; therefore all appeals from a church-judicatorie to the magiſtrate, are but from an inſeriour court of the magiſtrate to a ſuperiour of the ſame magiſtrate. Rivet on the decalogue had not learned ſuch ſquibs of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions betwixt appeals and refuges, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and declinators; for by any means he would have men to appeal to the magiſtrate from church-ſentences: <hi>Miniſters as miniſters are the ſubjects of the ſoveraign magiſtrate, and why may it not be lawfull for ſubjects to appeal from the judgements of ſubjects to the ſupreme magiſtrate? and why may it not be lawfull to the ſupreme magiſtrate to review the judgements of his ſubjects, to ratifie them, if they be good, and aboliſh them, if they be bad?</hi> For call thoſe removals what you will, ſo that the thing be ſtill the ſame: for he that from an unjuſt ſentence of a church-judicatorie hath his recourſe to the magiſtrate, both declines the ſentence of that court, appeals to a higher court, and makes his complaint to him that can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe him, help him, and diſannull the firſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. I confeſſe, if a man be condemned in England, he may have his refuge to ſome neighbour Prince: but this Prince can but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect him from the execution of the ſentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; but cannot diſannull the ſentence againſt him, nor reſtore him in <hi>statu quo prius.</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:123664:62"/> Such are the examples of Chryſoſtomus, Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vianus and Athanaſius, which are to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: for they repaired to the Biſhop of Rome, deſiring indeed to be judged by him; but they did not look upon him as their ſuperiour that could relieve them, and quaſh the ſentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; they repaired to him only as to a mediatour and interceſſour.</p>
               <p>Authorities ſhould now make good what I have proved to be conſonant to reaſon, ſuch as might be brought out of the beſt reformers, as Martyr, Reynolds, Pareus, Chamier; who make no other ſupreme viſible governour of the church then the ſoveraign magiſtrate: but I will not trouble the reader with many quotations. Yet to ſhew that this is no new doctrine, I might produce ſome famous Romiſh authors, who thought no leſſe in the darkeſt times of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: for ſo Claude Fauchet hath left written, a famous Hiſtorian and a Papiſt, in his book of the liberties of the Gallicane church; who out of Gregorie of Tours, and the practiſe of his time, proveth that the Kings of France were reputed heads of the church: a title which many 100. years after was much found fault with in the Kings of England, by the Romaniſts, yea by ſome reformers. He concludes his diſcourſe thus: <hi>which ſheweth, that the Biſhops of that time did hold, the King, aſſiſted by his counſell of State, to be under God head on earth of the church in his Kingdom, and not the Pope; whom
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:123664:63"/> if they had looked on as the head, they would have ſent unto him the concluſion of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill of Orleans, and not to King Clovis.</hi> So ſpeaketh the author of the Review of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill of Trent, <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>The eccleſiaſticks in France do not hold their eccleſiaſtick juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the Pope, but from the King; though the Ieſuits teach otherwiſe.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>The ſtrength of Mr. Gilleſpies reaſons, to diſprove that the magiſtrate is not chief governour of the church under Chriſt, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ALl that I have ſaid doth ſufficiently over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw what Mr. Gilleſpie alledgeth for a double juriſdiction, and againſt the magiſtrates being the chief governour of the church under Chriſt. To make good that, in a hundred places he doth much under value the magiſtrates power in ſacred things: namely p. 187. <hi>that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, though Chriſtian and godly, doth not</hi> exnatura rei, <hi>and in regard of his particular vocation, intend the glory of Ieſus Chriſt, as mediator and King of the church.</hi> In the next page; <hi>The glory of Ieſus Chriſt, as mediatour and King of the church, is not the end of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy.</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:123664:63"/> And in the ſame page he ſaith, that the end of magiſtracy is not godlineſſe &amp; honeſty, but peace and quietneſſe. Pag. 235. he ſaith, <hi>the magiſtrate is not to rule in the name of Chriſt.</hi> Pag. 250. he ſaith, <hi>the magiſtrate of England is not a member of the church as a magiſtrate, but as a Chriſtian.</hi> In the 294. page; <hi>the civil magiſtrate is Gods viceregent, not Christs:</hi> and ibid. <hi>If the magiſtrate be ſupreme head and governour of the church under Chriſt, then the miniſters of the church are the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates miniſters as well as Chriſts, and muſt act in the magistrates name, and as ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to him; and the magiſtrate ſhall be Chriſts minister, and act in Chriſts name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By all this he declareth his opinion, more then he proveth it. But to elude whatever ſtrength this carries, I further adde, that God maketh uſe of two main inſtruments to promote and advance the Kingdom of Chriſt as media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is the ſacred function, wholly ſet a part by God to preach the glad tidings of God reconciled to the world: which function was firſt laid on Chriſt, and then on the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and the miniſters of the Goſpell, who are embaſſadors and meſſengers of &amp; from Chriſt. In this function there is no juriſdiction annexed, but what the ſpirit in the word hath upon mens hearts for their conviction and converſion. In the exerciſe of this function there is no law
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:123664:64"/> made by him that bears it, but the law of the ſpirit; no cenſure inflicted, but on ſuch as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther willingly and not by conſtraint undergo it, and choſe whether they will or no; or when it pleaſeth God in judgement to afflict the deſpiſers of Gods miniſters &amp; ordinances. This function, I grant, is not exerciſed in the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates name, but Chriſts, nor is it ſubordinate to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing ſervient (if I may ſo ſpeak) and ſubſervient to the promoting of the Kingdom of Chriſt, is the magiſtrate and magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy; in as much as (which I ſaid before) it cannot be that miniſters and people aſſemble, ſynods be called, an outward government ſettled, lawes publiſhed, good men rewarded, bad men puniſhed, hereſies and hereticks rejected, miniſters maintained, union preſerved, except miniſters, people, ſynods be inveſted with a power of magiſtrate and magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
               <p>Theſe two, as I ſuppoſe, being undeniably true, all Mr. Gilleſpies aſſertions above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned will be found built upon the ſand. The magiſtrate having not the ſacred function on him, is no miniſter nor ambaſſadour of and from Chriſt, neither doth the inward operative juriſdiction annexed to the ſacred function a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from magiſtracy <hi>ex natura rei.</hi> In that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the miniſter preaching the Goſpell, and exerciſing his paſtorall function, is not the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:123664:64" rendition="simple:additions"/> magiſtrates miniſter, but Chriſts. But as magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy is the ſecond neceſſary inſtrument which God employeth to promote the Kingdom of his Son in the world; and for as much as it cannot be ſo much as imagined, that magiſtracy is inherent in all paſtors and aſſemblies of churches and ſynods; no doubt but the miniſters in that conſideration may be called the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates miniſters, as both in the ſame reſpect are Chriſts miniſters. If Chriſts Kingdom cannot be nor ever was promoted without magiſtracy actually preſent and acting, then the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate is a main miniſter of Chriſt in thoſe acts.</p>
               <p>Reverend and learned Mr. Lightfoot, in his Harmony of the New Teſtament, upon the 1 Cor. 5. clearly evinceth, that church-officers cannot be ſo much as conceived to govern the churches without magiſtracy either aſſumed or delegated: for having told us, that every ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of the Jewes had magiſtracy within their own body, judging betwixt party and party in matters of money, Health, damage, yea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting corporall puniſhments; he addeth, <hi>all things well conſidered, it may not be ſo mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrons as it ſeems to ſome, to ſay, it might very well be ſo in thoſe times of Chriſtian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations: for ſince, as it might be ſhewed, Chriſt and his Apoſtles, in platforming the modell of Chriſtian churches in thoſe times, did keep very cloſe to the platform of ſynagogues;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:123664:65"/> and ſince the Romans in thoſe times made no difference betwixt Iewes Iudaizing, and Iewes that were turned Christians, for as yet there was no perſecution raiſed againſt Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; why might not Chriſtian congregations have and exerciſe their double function of miniſtry and magiſtracy in them, as well as the Iewiſh ſynagogues? and if that much controverted place,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>ſhould be interpreted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſuch a rule, it were neither irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall nor improbable.</hi> Here by the way one may ſee, that in ſynagogues there were ſeverall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, but one <hi>Imperium</hi> and juriſdiction, which was that of magiſtracy; 2. that the churches of Chriſtians were modelled according to Iewiſh ſynagogues; 3. that every church had both miniſtery and magiſtracy.</p>
               <p>By this likewiſe down goeth what he ſaith, that the magiſtrate, though Chriſtian and godly, doth not in regard of his particular vocation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the glory of Jeſus Chriſt, as mediatour and King of the church. The main end as well as duty of magiſtracy is, the care of religion, and ſo of Chriſtian religion: his aime is, and ought to be, not ſo much peace and quietneſſe, as god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and honeſty. Muſt a magiſtrate hide his power, which is his talent, in a napkin? were not Adam, Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob, by their paternall, magiſtraticall power tyed to promote Gods true worſhip?</p>
               <p>It is very ſtrange doctrine, when he ſaith
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:123664:65"/> p. 189. that the end of an eccleſiaſticall ſentence, as delivering to Satan, is, that men may learn not to blaſpheme; but the end of the magiſtrate in puniſhing blaſphemers, is only that juſtice may be done according to law, and that peace and good order may be maintained. A rank papiſt could hardly ſpeak more crudely. Ought not this to be the end of the magiſtrate in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing tranſgreſſours, if it be not by death, that they may change their lives, and be better then they were? Were not reformation of life the end for which a blaſphemer is puniſhed, but only peace and quietneſſe, the magiſtrate might as well let him go unpuniſhed, if he can but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his end, which, as Mr. Gilleſpie ſaith, is peace and quietneſſe; which hath been often obtained when no blaſphemers were puniſhed. It is obſerved, that in Auguſtus time there was for 12. years through all the Roman Empire peace and quietneſſe, though the life of all his ſubjects were a perpetuall blaſphemy againſt God.</p>
               <p>But, I pray, how can Chriſts church be ruled by magiſtracy, except it be in the name of Chriſt, promote the intereſt of Jeſus Chriſt, and ayme at the glory of Jeſus Chriſt? When he ſaith, that the magi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>rate of England is not a member of the church as a magiſtrate, but as a Chriſtian, and that he governs not as a Chriſtian, but as a magiſtrate; I confeſſe I underſtand not, why I may not ſay as well, that a paſtor is not a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:123664:66"/> of a church as paſtor, but as a Chriſtian: for there be in the church as well Balaams and falſe teachers, as perſecuting magiſtrates. Why may I not ſay, that a father is not to teach the fear of the Lord to his ſon as a father, but as a Chriſtian? for the magiſtrate is not to rule and order affairs of the church as a Chriſtian, but as a magiſtrate: otherwiſe a Chriſtian, without the office of magiſtracy, might do the like. How can the duty about the exerciſe of a power be divided from the power it ſelf, as that a magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ſhould be by his duty of magiſtracy keeper of both tables, and yet ſhould have no power given from God for the keeping of theſe tables?</p>
               <p>But, which is moſt al ſurd, how can the keeping of the two tables under the Goſpell be ſeparate from the keeping of the doctrine and diſcipline of the Goſpell, as that the magiſtrate ſhould be keeper of one, and the paſtors of the other? If the magiſtrate under the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was keeper not only of the decalogue, but alſo of the covenant of grace, by which the people of Iſrael was diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of the world; what hinders but he ſhould be under the Goſpells adminiſtration a keeper both of the law and Goſpell? except Mr. Gilleſpie ſay, that the prieſts were keepers of the law whereof David ſpeaketh in the 19 Pſalme, and the magiſtrate keeper of the two tables given in mount Sinai.</p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:123664:66"/>
               <p>As for the magiſtrates being a member of the church, and therefore no head or governour of the church; I believe he is as much lyable to ſubmit and ſtoup his will to the commands of Chriſt in the miniſtery, as the loweſt in the congregation: he muſt acknowledge his miniſter the better man, as honoured with the higheſt function that ever was, and which the Son of God our Lord Jeſus Chriſt took upon him. But were all the miniſters of the Goſpell as many Jeſus Chriſts, I would yield unto them all alike juriſdiction over the wills and minds of men; but deny them an externall coercive judiciall power over their bodies, eſtates, liberties, &amp;c.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Mr. Gilleſpies manifeſt contradictions in ſtating the magiſtrates power in matters of Religion.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BUt I will plainly ſhew, that in this matter Mr. Gilleſpie doth manifeſtly contradict himſelf, and ſtands on no ſure ground: for what he hath taken from the magiſtrate in ſome places, in others he reſtoreth to him: In ſome he grants as much to the magiſtrate as if he had been another Eraſtus; in others he gives him nothing at all, and makes eccleſiaſticall and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil juriſdiction to be <hi>res diſparatae,</hi> or things as
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:123664:67"/> much different as wiſedome and a candleſtick, being of ſeverall claſſes and predicaments, ſo that one hath nothing to meddle with the other. Thus pag. 253. theſe be his words: <hi>We deny that in a well-conſtituted church, it is agreeable to the will of Christ for the magiſtrate either to receive appeals, properly ſo called, from the ſentence of an eccleſiaſticall court, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive complaints exhibited against that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence by that party cenſured, ſo as by his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority upon ſuch a complaint to nullify or make void the eccleſiasticall cenſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This indeed is <hi>imperium in imperio,</hi> a juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction within a juriſdiction, and independent from it. Mr. Gilleſpie would not have a man to appeal from the presbytery or ſynod, or make complaints to the magiſtrate, nor a magiſtrate to receive the complaints; but he is contented that the magiſtrate ſhould act the part of an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner, in compelling the party cenſured to ſubmit to the church-cenſure: which indeed is a moſt ungodly and tyrannicall proceeding, like that of Pope Julius the 2. who would have King Lewis the 12. to execute the ſentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Waldenſes by deſtroying them by the ſword, and burning their cities, without taking any cognizance of the fact. And ſince all church-cenſures do ſignify juſt nothing, without a power of magiſtracy giving its ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for effectuating the ſentence of the church; here, if we believe Mr. Gilleſpie, the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:123664:67"/> paſtor is like the intellect, and the magiſtrate the will, this following with a blind obedience the dictates of that.</p>
               <p>But who ſhall judge, when the church is well conſtituted, that then the magiſtrate may not receive complaints and appeals? and may not ſometimes wrong proceedings und unjuſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences paſſe in a well-conſtituted church, ſo long as a church never ſo pure is not infallible? and on the contrary, may not an unſettled church be very juſt in their cenſures? why then ſhould it be more agreeable to the will of Chriſt to receive appeals from a juſt ſentence in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettled church, then from an unjuſt one when the church is well-conſtituted? But when was ever ſuch a well-conſtituted church, unerring in their judgement, as all appeals from their judgement to another ſhould be unlawfull? was or is that church well-conſtituted, that either ever claſhed with magiſtracy, or was divided in it ſelf, as now it is?</p>
               <p>Now we ſhall find Mr. Gilleſpie playing two other parts: under the one he aſcribeth to the magiſtrate as much as ever they challenged; under the other vizard he chalks a middle way of magiſtrates power in ſacred things, in which he ſeems to give ſomething to the magiſtrate, but in truth gives nothing: however he is ſure to raiſe a duſt of diſtinctions, that neither ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy one nor the other.</p>
               <p>Pag. 259. he alledgeth the 25. article of the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:123664:68"/> confeſſion of the church of Scotland, which ſaith, <hi>that to Kings, Princes, rulers and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates chiefly and most principally the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and the purgation of religion per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth; ſo that not only they are appointed for civil policy, but alſo for maintenance of the true religion, and for ſuppreſſing idolatry, and all ſuperſtition what ſoever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He who never had heard of a double juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, eccleſiaſticall and civil, or of a power of excommunicating, depoſing, making lawes, and determining ſo authoritatively about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith and diſcipline, that the magiſtrate is not to reviſe their judgements, or receive complaints from church-judicatories; he who never, I ſay, had heard of theſe poſitions, would never deduct them by any conſequence out of the words of the confeſſion of Scotland quoted by Mr. Gilleſpie: for quite contrary, they unite all power into one; make the magiſtrate ſole governour of churches, nationall, provinciall, and conſiſtoriall, and ſole judge of hereſies, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, decrees, and church-cenſures; and beſides overturn all Mr. Gilleſpies ground, upon which he thinks to have laid very faſt the fabrick of his eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction independent from the magiſtrate; and laſtly, reinveſt the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate with the right and power which Mr. Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſpie hath taken from him, when every where he denieth theſe three things, 1. that the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate as magiſtrate intends the glory of Jeſus
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:123664:68"/> Chriſt, no otherwiſe then a ſea-man or a picture-drawer as ſuch, (ſee p. 187.) 2. that he is to rule in the name of Chriſt, p. 235. 3. that a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate as ſuch is ſubſervient to Chriſt as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour.

That article of the confeſſion aſcribeth to the magiſtrate at leaſt an equall juriſdiction over eccleſiaſticall perſons and things which he hath over civil, for they ſay, <hi>he is appointed not only for civil policy, but alſo for maintenance of the true religion:</hi> ſo that equally he is charged by God to extirpate hereſies, reform the church, and to purge the Commonwealth from ſeditions, abuſes, crimes, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yea the article puts a great deal more ſtreſſe of duty upon the magiſtrate to govern the church, and maintain and reform the true religion, then to rule the Commonwealth; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, making the end and ayme of magiſtrates and magiſtracy not ſo much peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as honeſty and godlineſſe; and not ſo much the glory of his dominions, as that of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But how can it be that, as the article ſaith, the magiſtrate ſhould be appointed by God chiefly and principally for maintaining the true religion, for purging it from hereſies, ſchiſme, idolatry, &amp;c. and yet the while he ſhould not
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:123664:69"/> rule in the name of Chriſt, nor ſhould be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt as me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, as Mr. G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lleſpie ſpeaketh? Can the Lord Ieſus appoint officers, whoſe office and place is chiefly and principally to promote the intereſt of Ieſus Chriſt, and yet thoſe officers ſhall not intend that which chiefly they are to intend, and are appointed for, namely the glory of Ieſus Chriſt, and the advancement of his Kingdom? How can the article ſtand with what he ſaith p. 187. that magiſtrates as ſuch do not intend the glory of Ieſus Chriſt, otherwiſe then a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, a printer, a merchant? So that by what he ſaith, the magiſtrates act towards the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting and advancing Chriſts Kingdom hath no more congruity then the act of a phyſitian building a houſe, which he doth not build as a phyſitian, but as an architect and builder. Thus Mr. Gilleſpie maketh not a magiſtrate or magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy, but his Chriſtian profeſſion, ſubſervient to the intereſt of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But how can the magiſtrates principall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be to purge religion, extirpate idolatry and hereſy, with a power only depending on God, except his judgement, in diſcerning what is true religion and what idolatry, be as abſolute and independent on any judicatory, as his power and duty is? It God hath placed in the ſame perſon or perſons both a duty and a power to reforme and purge religion, ſure he hath not denyed him the main condition required to the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:123664:69"/> diſcharge of that duty, and the exerciſe of that power; and that condition is the duty of a judge, whoſe judgement of a law or ſentence, whether right or wrong, goeth alwayes along with his judicall power: ſo that the magiſtrate muſt judge with a judgement of diſcretion, and approbation of the truth, the goodneſſe &amp; equity of any matter propounded to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, decree, or judiciall ſentence, obliging externally men to obedience.</p>
               <p>This language of the article of the confeſſion of Scotland falls ſometimes from Mr. Gilleſpies pen, as pag. 187. <hi>It lyes upon the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to advance that high and eminent voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his, that Chriſt may be glorified as King of the church:</hi> and p. 191. he ſaith, <hi>magiſtrates are appointed not only for civil policy, but for the conſervation and purgation of religion.</hi> But Mr. Gilleſpie may be well excuſed, if he let fall ſuch paſſages from his pen, pulling down with one hand what he hath ſet up with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for Beza, a great advocate of eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction, and by whom it hath taken a great riſe, will ſometimes thus forget himſelf, namely in an epiſtle of his (it is the 83.) to a nameleſſe friend, beating down at one blow his eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call juriſdiction independent from the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. The words are: <hi>Docet nos igitur Dei verbum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The word of God teacheth us, that it is the duty of magiſtrates, to be even the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:123664:70"/> chief guardians of eccleſiaſticall order. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their charge is to look and provide, that a presbytery rightly conſtituted according to the word of God, do act all things lawfully, and when need is, to interpoſe their authority, that things well judged and conſtituted be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that the ring leaders of diſorders be reſtrained and puniſhed according to their deſerts. So likewiſe it is the office of the presbyterie, to implore the ayd of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate when needfull, and obey him when he rightly admoniſheth.</hi> Certain it is, the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate is made here ſole judge, to pronounce when the presbyterie is well conſtituted, and its judgements are right, and to interpoſe his authority as he ſeeth cauſe. And at the end of the epiſtle, <hi>officium magistratus vel hoc prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipuum eſt, ut qui Domino miniſtrant legitime vocentur, &amp; rite officio ſuo fungantur; It is even the chief duty of the magistrate, that thoſe that minister to the Lord be lawfully called, and perform well their office.</hi> Thus the magiſtrate is made judge of the lawfullneſſe of the call, and when miniſters diſcharge their places aright. Sure he that hath the power to judge of the lawfulneſſe of a call, hath likewiſe power to make the call null and void, in caſe it be not valid enough in his apprehenſion and judgement. Good Lord! what need is there to trouble the world with a diſtinct power from the magiſtrate, which is thus evacuated and made void by another power?</p>

               <p>THus we ſee that even Eraſtus could ſay no more then Mr. Gilleſpie and the confeſſion of Scotland. But Mr. Gilleſpie hath many eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of modalities, cauſalities, and diſtinctions of power, by which he ſeems ſometimes to make large conceſſions to the magiſtrate; but which, when he pleaſeth, and it ſerves his turn, he can elude and bring to nothing, throwing in the eyes diſtinctions in great ſtore, to confound the judgement; which is a ſtrong argument of weakneſſe &amp; unſoundneſſe, as of a houſe, ſo of a cauſe, when they need ſo many ſupporters: whereas thoſe that plead for the magiſtrates power in ſacred things, have need but of one only rule, to ſtate and define the whole contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy about the magiſtrates power, and the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

               <p>It were an endleſſe labour, to bring into a body all the diviſions, diſtinctions, cauſalities, modalities, forms and objects of powers, diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Mr. Gilleſpies book. Pag. 191. he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth two objects about which eccleſiaſticall power is converſant: firſt, the object of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates care of religion, and the object of the operation of that care. Thus he and others make a power which he calls a care of the religion, and another a care about religion.</p>
               <p>As for the power itſelf conſidered generally,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:123664:71"/> they make it double, eccleſiaſticall and civil: this is wholly the magiſtrates; in the other the magiſtrate hath alſo a ſhare: for they ſay, this eccieſiaſticall power is exerciſed either in a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick way, or in an eccleſiaſticall way: thus they make an eccleſiaſticall civil power reſiding in the magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>Next, they divide eccleſiaſticall power into intrinſecall and extrinſecall, into direct and indirect; the extrinſecall and indirect they yield to the magiſtrate: thus you have again an eccleſiaſticall power belonging to the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. Again, they have an objective and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall eccleſiaſticall power, which needeth a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubdiviſion to be underſtood: for they make an objective eccleſiaſticall power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant about perſons and things; and this, they ſay, belongeth only to the magiſtrate; and a formall eccleſiaſticall power, in which the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate hath his ſhare with the miniſters: ſo that of theſe two eccleſiaſticall powers, objective and formall, it will prove that the magiſtrate hath 3. parts, and the miniſters but one: for this eccleſiaſticall formall power is again divided by them, into a power exerciſed <hi>ratione objecti</hi> objective-way, about things and perſons, which kind of power, ſay they, belongs to the ſole ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate; and into a power exerciſed in an eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall way, which they ſay is the miniſters portion.</p>
               <p>Pag. 261. he hath an eccleſiaſticall power,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:123664:72"/> which he divides into perfect and imperfect, which he calls <hi>pro tanto:</hi> of this ſtamp is this diviſion of eccleſiaſticall power into the power of every way, and the power <hi>more ſuo:</hi> which diſtinctions are ſo ſubtile, that they are beyond Scotus apprehenſion. He hath alſo a diviſion of eccleſiaſticall power into imperative and elici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; this is proper to miniſters, that to magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates: and then an eccleſiaſticall power and juriſdiction properly ſo called, and another improperly ſo called. The juriſdiction impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called he and all his brethren aſcribe to the miniſters: but the juriſdiction properly ſo called to the magiſtrate. Which thing no way agreeth with the diviſion of eccleſiaſticall power into perfect and imperfect above-mentioned: for whereas they make the perfect eccleſiaſticall power to belong to the miniſters, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect to the magiſtrate; here they make the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall power properly ſo called to pertain to the magiſtrate, and the power improperly ſo called to the miniſters: ſo that, if we believe them, the power properly ſo called ſhall be the imperfect power, as on the contrary, the power improperly ſo called ſhall be the perfect power; which is againſt any mans common ſenſe and logick.</p>
               <p>By the help of theſe diſtinctions, the Popes and their advocates have defended the power of excommunicating and depoſing Kings, yea of diſpoſing of their tempora<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They further di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide it into elicitive and coercive; into primary and ſecondary power; into the power managed directly, and <hi>ex conſequenti;</hi> into a power of reforming abuſes under the notion of formality of ſcandall, and a power under the notion of formality of crime. And, to draw to an end of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding, they have more diviſions of eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call powers, as into directive and coercive; cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulative and privative; auxiliary and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive; declarative and executive; authoritative &amp; conſtitutive: the auxiliary they derive from Charles the great, <hi>capitulari Car. mag.

               <p>I have one diviſion more of eccleſiaſticall power, brought by Amyraldus and ſome others, quite different from the reſt, being not a dichotomie, but a trichotomie; not a diviſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two, but three coordinate powers; the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the magiſtrate, the ſecond to lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elders and deputies of the church, and the third appertaining to miniſters. Theſe three eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall powers he maketh to be conſpicuous in all eccleſiaſticall aſſemblies and ſynods: where the magiſtrate hath his eccleſiaſticall indirect extrinſecall power, as they call it, the miniſters have their intrin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>call direct eccleſiaſticall power, and the lay-elders have a leſſe intrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call direct eccleſiaſticall power, for it hath not found a name yet; for it is (ſay they) neither of the nature of eccleſiaſticall power belonging to the magiſtrate, nor of that which is proper to miniſters, but a mungrell eccleſiaſticall power, in regard they cannot perform by their power thoſe acts that belong either to magiſtracy or miniſtery. For beſides that they cannot preach and adminiſter the Sacraments, Amyraldus will not allow them any voice, but conſultative,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:123664:73"/> not deliberative, and only in matters of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and eccleſiaſticall policy: and that power, they ſay, they have common with the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, who over and above hath his eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call power, which neither the miniſters nor lay-elders have any thing to do with. Laſtly, the miniſters have their eccleſiaſticall power diſtinct from the eccleſiaſticall power of both.</p>
               <p>The bare relating of theſe diviſions of power and modifications of eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction, is ſufficient to confute them; ſo that there is little need of authority to witneſſe their nullity and vanity. Yet three grave and learned di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, namely Martyr, Muſculus and Gualte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, would have the name and the thing to be aboliſhed. Martyr <hi>loc. com.</hi> 13. <hi>claſſ.</hi> 4. § 9. ſheweth the little need of multiplying powers, <hi>whenas that of the magiſtrate is ſufficient; and that David, Salomon, Ioſias, being civil magiſtrates, did think that religion belonged to their care; and Conſtantinus, Theodoſius, Iustinianus, had no greater thought then to conſtitute the true church of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Muſculus is yet more pregnant, <hi>loc. com. de magiſtratibus: what hinders, I pray, but that this may be eccleſiaſticall, which is done nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the church it ſelf, nor in the name and by the power of the church, but is done, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and enjoyned by the magiſtrate within the church, in the name and power of God, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:123664:74"/> to procure the good of the church, and repreſſe the evils committed in the church?</hi> A little lower he hath theſe expreſſe and golden words: <hi>the way and nature of government cannot bear, that in the ſame people there be two authentick powers, two diverſe legiſlations and domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, except it be by ſubordination; as there is no place for two heads in one body.</hi>

               <p>Pag. 264. <hi>The coercive part, in compelling the obſtinate and unruly to ſubmit to the pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteriall and ſynodicall ſentence, belongs to the magiſtrate: not as if the magiſtrate had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do but to be an executioner of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of church officers, or as if he were by a blind and implicite faith to conſtrain all men to ſtand to their determination; God forbid. The magiſtrate muſt have his full liberty to judge of that which he is to compell men to do; to judge of it not only judicio apprehenſivo, by underſtanding and apprehending aright what it is, but judicio diſcretivo, by the judgement of Chriſtian prudence and diſcretion, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining by the word of God the grounds, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and warrants of the thing, that he may in faith, and not doubtingly, adde his authority thereto: in which judging he doth judicare, not judicem agere; that is, he is judex ſuarum actionum, he judgeth whether he ought to adde his civil authority to this or that which ſeemeth good to church-officers, and doth not concur therewith, except he be ſatisfied in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi>

               <p>Whoever examineth narrowly the extent of power which he yields to belong to the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, will ſoon diſcover that all the eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:123664:75"/> power is to be managed by the magiſtrate. 1. He maketh all ſynodicall or presbyterian power to be of no force, without a coercive power: 2. that the magiſtrate muſt have his full liberty to judge of the ſentence, before he cauſeth it to be executed: 3. that the magiſtrate having both the laſt judgement of approbation, and of that they call <hi>imperative,</hi> or command, to yield obedience to the declarations and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of ſynods or conſiſtories, it is plain, he is the ſoveraign judge of all eccleſiaſticall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſentences and debates, and that they are but counſells and advices, till the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate approveth of them, and commandeth them.</p>
               <p>This ſingle paſſage of Mr. Gilleſpie graunted unto him, might ſerve for an anſwer to all his book, &amp; would overthrow all eccleſiaſticall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction. And indeed all the controverſie lieth in the narrow compaſſe of theſe few lines of his, the matter of which by right ſhould have been the main ſubject and bulk of his book, and not have been ſo ſlightly paſſed over: for this is the very hinge, on which Gualterus and Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covius conceive that the whole controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Eraſtus and his oppoſites hung, and which, as it is ſtated by Maccovius, will give a bone to pick till doomſday to the aſſertors of an eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction; it is a Gordian knot, which they will never diſintangle, but by cutting of it, the truth of it being ſo undeniable,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:123664:76"/> that it was never anſwered by Walaeus, Apolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Triglandius, nor by Mr. Gilleſpie, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in this paragraph alledgeth the ſubſtance of Maccovius poſitions, but doth not anſwer them to any purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The three poſitions of Maccovius are brought by ſeverall in various terms, but all to the ſame purpoſe, and are theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is the duty of the magiſtrate to look and take order that the word of God be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with purity, that the Sacraments and the diſcipline of the church be duely adminiſtred, and to make a diligent enquiry into the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters performing of theſe, and to puniſh them if either they miſſe, or do amiſſe in the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their places.</hi> Which words of Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covius, Rivetus upon the decalogue doth expreſſe in equivalent terms. <hi>It is the duty of ministers to infuſe doctrine, to wound by cenſures, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister the ſacraments immediatly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, and, as they ſpeak, ex officio, by their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Now the magiſtrate, under whoſe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity theſe things are to be done, if ministers do not perform them, by his grave and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding power may and ought to force them, and enjo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n them to do theſe things, and to do them well; and to puniſh them that do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then they ſhould do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond poſition of Maccovius is; <hi>Since no determinations or ſentences of presbyteries and ſynods have any force of obligation in them
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:123664:76"/> to obedience, without the ſanction of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate; therefore not the presbyteries and ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, but the magiſtrate is the ſupreme judge, giver and maker of all conſtitutions, ſentences and determinations of conſistories and ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The third is; <hi>The magiſtrate is either to put his ſeal of ſanction, and give his judgement of approbation to all the judgements, ſentences and definitions of ſynods, with a blind judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſtand, without diſputing within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to what they agreed and decreed among themſelves; or he muſt diſapprove thoſe things that in his own apprehenſion are not good and convenient, and approve what he conceiveth to be true, juſt and fit. Whatever the oppoſers choſe, they are at a ſtand; for they make the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate either a ſoveraign judge and arbiter over all eccleſiaſticall matters, or a ſergeant and blind executioner of the judgements and ſentences of ſynods and presbyteries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Gilleſpie being not able any way to make invalide the ſtrength of theſe poſitions of Maccovius, only ſaith, that the magiſtrate, in having the laſt view and cognizance of all ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall determinations, and giving his ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to them, does not <hi>judicem agree,</hi> but <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>care;</hi> which I know not how to Engliſh, but that in ſo doing he doth not the part of a judge, and yet doth judge of the thing. But what ſtrength hath this? That man doth the part of a
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:123664:77"/> judge, in whoſe power and breaſt it is to make valid and currant, or to diſannull whatever is debated and determined by others. Of much like ſtrength is it, when he ſaith, <hi>that the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate judgeth whether he ought to adde his civil authority to this or that, which ſeemeth good to church-officers, and doth not concur therewith, except he be ſatisfied in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</hi> Which if he may do, the magiſtrate hath as much as Maccovius proveth to belong to him: for in that he is not ſatisfied, and doth not concur with the judgements of church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>officers, he maketh all their judgements void &amp; null &amp; of no force, to oblige either actively or paſſively any man or aſſembly under his juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. Had not the ſtates of the low-countreys approved and ratified the ſynod of Dordrecht, their decrees would have been but counſells, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and anſwers of prudent and wiſe men, and had not put any obligation upon the miniſters, churches, ſchools and academies within their dominions, more then upon England or France, to be conformable to their determinations.</p>
               <p>Next, in the concluſion, Mr. Gilleſpie ſaith, that <hi>this doth not make him ſupreme judge and governour in eccleſiaſticall cauſes, which is the prerogative of Ieſus Chriſt; nor yet doth it invest the magiſtrate with the ſubordinate miniſteriall forinſecall directive judgement in eccleſiaſticall things or cauſes, which belongeth to an eccleſiaſticall, not to a civil court.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:123664:77"/>
               <p>I underſtand not wherefore he bringeth this; for what he hath ſaid before doth ſufficiently evince the magiſtrate to be ſoveraign judge and governour over all perſons, and in all eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call cauſes and cenſures, ſo long as they are of no force, and cannot be brought to execution, except the magiſtrate approves of them, and commands them. It ſeemeth Mr. Gilleſpie, by theſe words, would put it to the vote, who muſt be the ſupreme judge and governour in eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall cauſes; whether the miniſters, or the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate. It is ſure enough, if we believe him, the magiſtrate muſt not be. It remains then that the miniſters ſhould be the ſupreme judges and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors: for all M. Gilleſpies drift is, to take from the magiſtrate that which he ſaith duly pertaineth to the miniſters, and in ſhort, to put, as he conceiveth, the ſaddle upon the right horſe. For to what end ſhould he except againſt the magiſtrates being inveſted with the power of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme judgement and government in eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall cauſes, but to reinveſt the miniſters into it, and to declare, that that uſurpation in the magiſtrate was done to the prejudice and wrong of the miniſters, to whom it is due by right?</p>
               <p>Here then Mr. Gilleſpie maketh the miniſters of the Goſpell ſupreme judges and governors in eccleſiaſticall cauſes; whereas he alwayes before declined thoſe titles, as belonging only to and being the prerogative of Jeſus Chriſt. But ſuppoſe
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:123664:78"/> miniſters in ſynods and conſiſtories had alſo the coercive power, and were inveſted with that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall juriſdiction, that giveth force and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to all their cenſures; this, I trow, would not make them more or leſſe ſupreme judges and governors in eccleſiaſticall cauſes, then the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate inveſted with the ſame power. Since then the magiſtrate takes no more upon himſelf, then ſuch an externall juriſdiction as miniſters might well aſſume by the delegation or conceſſion of the magiſtrate; why ſhould Mr. Gilleſpie hence inferre, that this power in magiſtrates maketh not them ſupreme judges and governors, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the ſame juriſdiction laid upon miniſters nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maketh them ſupreme judges and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors in eccleſiaſticall cauſes? No hurt then to the magiſtrate by this inference, only that it ſeemeth to acknowledge, that ſome do hold the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to be ſupreme judge and governour in ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall cauſes, giving him a prerogative which belongeth only to Jeſus Chriſt. I believe none of his oppoſites ſpoke in that crude man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Magiſtrates are not unerring judges; they fail many times in their judgement, both decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative and of diſcretion: ſo do the miniſters; and therefore there is no ſupreme viſible judge and governour in eccleſiaſticalls, to whoſe deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, determinations and commands a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is obliged to yield further then it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened or convinced: for there being a tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall in every ones conſcience, uſuall appeals are
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:123664:78"/> made to it from the magiſtrate, yea from the ſentences of ſynods and presbyteries. This is the prerogative of Jeſus Chriſt, by a ſoveraign judgement and determination to reſolve the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect, incline the will, and convince the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. The magiſtrate is not made by any of Mr. Gilleſpies oppoſites, as far as I know, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſupreme head or governour in eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call cauſes, then Martyr, Zanchius, Pareus, &amp;c. make him head of the church.</p>
               <p>He further ſaith, that what he ſtated about the power of the magiſtrate in eccleſiaſticall things, doth not inveſt him with the ſubordinate miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall forinſecall judgement in eccleſiaſticall things or cauſes. I think, if Scotus were living, he would hardly underſtand what is the meaning of miniſteriall forinſecall directive judgement; for the word <hi>miniſteriall</hi> is no way forinſecall: for the ſtile of forinſecall maketh the miniſter ſit in a court of judicature as the judges at Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter Hall, giving ſentence which both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties muſt ſtand to, except they can appeal, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a redreſſe in a ſuperiour court. Again, the word <hi>directive</hi> agreeth no better with forinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, then the Papall title of <hi>ſervant of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> with <hi>God on earth,</hi> and <hi>the ſpouſe of Chriſt:</hi> for whereas the word <hi>forinſecall</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth no leave to the plaintiff or defendant to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the judgement of the court to his own ſenſe or apprehenſion; on the contrary the word <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:123664:79"/> the word, and hearken to the directions of the miniſter, a priviledge like that which St. Paul yieldeth to the people of Beroea, who having heard St. Paul, would be well ſatisfied ere they gave credit to him; for they ſearched the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to know whether it was ſo as St. Paul would have them to do, or as he ſaid unto them, and gave them directions.</p>

                  <p>Whether the Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath appointed, as the Rever. Aſſembly ſaith, officers in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment diſtinct from the magistrate.

               </argument>
               <p>IT remaineth in the examen of the firſt ſection of the 30. chapter of the confeſſion, we ſhould ſpeak a word of the church-officers, in whoſe hands the Rever. Aſſembly ſaith a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was appointed diſtinct from the civil magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>God indeed hath appointed in the church,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:123664:79"/> officers diſtinct from the magiſtrate; as he hath appointed in the law the magiſtracy of Moſes to be diſtinct from the Prieſthood of Aaron, and the Prieſts and Levites to have a diſtinct function from that of the rulers, elders, captains, judges, &amp;c. But God never appointed the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of Aaron and of the Prieſts and Levites to be diſtinct from that of Moſes and of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme magiſtrate; nor ever meant with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of offices and officers to introduce a diverſity and diſtinction of juriſdictions. For were the juriſdiction exerciſed by church-offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of ſo diſtinct a nature from the magiſtrates juriſdiction, as the paternall juriſdiction is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the maritall, and both from that of the magiſtrate; one could not thence infer, that they are not all three ſubordinate to one ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour juriſdiction: Coordinate juriſdictions, as of fathers, husbands, maſters of families, Majors of towns, are all ſubordinate to one ſupreme juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>But to prove that church-officers are not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God in a government diſtinct from that of the magiſtrate, but in ſubordination to it, the reverend Aſſembly make uſe of one place of Scripture, in their humble advice for govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which though they quote in the behalf of a double juriſdiction, yet it doth totally over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it: their words are;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As there were in the Iewes Church elders of the people joyned with the priests and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:123664:80"/> in the government of the church, (as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in</hi> 2 <hi>Chronic.</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9, 10. <hi>&amp;c.) ſo Chriſt, who hath inſtituted a government and governours eccleſiaſticall in the church, hath furniſhed ſome in his church beſides the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the word with gifts for government, and with commiſſion to execute the ſame when called thereunto; who are to joyn with the ministers in the government of the church, Rom.</hi> 12. 7, 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 28. <hi>which officers reformed churches commonly call Elders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One party or other is mightily miſtaken, and do wreſt the Scripture againſt the ſenſe of the holy Ghoſt, ſo clearly manifeſted in the literall meaning. I wiſh with all my heart, that as the reverend Divines and Mr. Gilleſpie propound to the Chriſtian church, that of the Jewes for an example of juriſdiction diſtinct from that of the magiſtrate; ſo they would take no other umpire and judge, to make good that double juriſdiction, then this text they have choſen: for I am confident, they will find their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in it; no place in the Scripture more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently aſſerting the confuſion of juriſdictions amongſt the Jewes then this. Me thinks the presbyterians &amp; anti-presbyterians both draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this text to their advantage, are like Salma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius and the miniſters of Leyden, about the queſtion of wearing long or ſhort hair; the miniſters making uſe of the ſame text 1 Cor. 11. againſt long hair, that Salmaſius doth againſt
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:123664:80"/> ſhort. But the whole context, from the 8 verſe to the end of the chapter, is wholly for us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The text ſaith verſe 8. that Ioſaphat ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the judgement of the Lord and for controverſies, Levites, Prieſts and chiefs of the families of Iſrael: here then you have firſt no diſtinction of judicatories, but rather of the heads either of families, or ſo called for their wiſedome, from all the 12. tribes of Iſrael, to one Iudicatory or Sanedrim, as the Rabbins &amp; the beſt interpreters think.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In ſetting them over affairs there is no diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction mentioned, as that the Prieſts &amp; Levites ſhould manage the eccleſiaſticall, &amp; the heads of families the civil; for expreſſely all kinds of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, about matters criminall &amp; not criminall, were to be judged by them jointly. So then the elders of the Jewiſh church cannot be a fit par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allel with the elders of the church of the new Teſtament; ſince the elders under the old Teſtament were judges even in capitall cauſes, but under the new they were not: beſides that the elders under the old Teſtament were to make but one councell &amp; one judicatorie with the Commonwealth, with the Judges and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the land; but neither the Rev. Aſſembly nor M. Gilleſpie will allow the elders of the new Teſtament, to have any thing to do to ſit as church-officers with the judges of the land, and to decide cauſes betwixt blood and blood.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But the eleventh verſe, concerning Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:123664:81"/> the chief Prieſt appointed to be over all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Lord, and Zebadiah for the Kings buſineſſes, doth further clear, that there was no ſuch thing amongſt the Jewes, as a government diſtinct from that of the magiſtrate; though many cry here <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, as if it were a ſtrong place for a diſtinct and double juriſdiction: for it is plain here, that Amariah the chief Prieſt was appointed to be, as Mr. Gilleſpie confeſſeth p. 146. the <hi>Naſi</hi> or Prince of the Sanedrim, and chief ruler of the Senate, whereof mention is made in the 8. verſe, and which was made up of Prieſts, Levites, and the elders of the people of Iſrael, and judged of ſuch cauſes and matters as uſually a high court of Parliament do. This Amariah, in that place of chief-preſidency in the Senate, is ſaid to be over all matters of the Lord; becauſe, as all manner of lawes, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions and ordinances, were all from God the author and latour, and from Moſes under God the giver of them all; ſo every matter or buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe concerning any of thoſe lawes violated and broken, or that needeth further explanation, by reaſon of the infinity of caſes, and the ſeeming contradictions between one law and another, was truely and properly called the matter of the Lord, and was debated in the Senate: for no doubt all cauſes about cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall lawes, and judgements concerning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of marriages, inheritances and ſuch like, were as well matter of the Lord, as the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <p n="4">4. Now for Zebadiah, the caſe is clear, that he was appointed either Steward, or Mr. Controller, it may be chamberlain of the Kings houſhold; or

               <argument>
                  <p>A caſe propounded by Mr. Ceſar Calandrin, which he conceiveth to aſſert a double ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, examined. Of the two courts; one of magiſtracy or externall, the other of conſcience or internall. That eccleſiasticall juriſdiction muſt belong to one of them, or to none.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MY noble and reverend friend Mr. Caeſar Calandrin propoundeth a caſe, which he hath often deſired me, by word of mouth and by letters, to ſatisfie him in. He is confident that by it a double juriſdiction is made good. I will ſet it down in his own words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A murtherer condemned to death, if he be truely penitent, the ſpirituall court doth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve him; and yet the civil magiſtrate ſhall puniſh him with death, though he be never ſo penitent: which evidently proveth, that the civil and eccleſiaſticall judicature do not enterfear, but are of a quite different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Elſe how can the magiſtrate puniſh him as guilty, who is abſolved by the Conſiſtory? or how can the Conſiſtory abſolve him, whom the magistrate doth condemn? The Conſiſtory by abſolving him in the ſpirituall court, doth not
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:123664:85"/> thereby at all oppoſethe ſentence of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the magiſtrate hath given againſt him in the civil court. The condemnation in the civil court ſtands in force, even then when in the ſpirituall court it is no longer a condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but is changed into abſolution upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. The magiſtrate doth not regard re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, becauſe his office doth not extend to the care of ſouls: the Conſistory muſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve and comfort the penitent, leſt Satan ſhould tempt him to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſpair. The magistrate cannot take exceptions, that the Conſistory ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolveth him whom the magiſtrate hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mned: nor can the Conſiſtory take exception, that the magiſtrate puts him to death whom the Conſiſtory hath abſolved. I adde, for further illuſtration, if the abſolution given by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory were upon grounds of his being innocent, or that his crime did not deſerve death; this, I confeſſe, would thwart the ſentence of the civil mag strate: but the Conſistory meddleth not with the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ntence of the magiſtrate, nor with his civil puniſhment, but labours to keep his ſoul, being penitent, in a right poſture, and to ſtrengthen it against temptations. The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment holds as well on the other ſide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The magiſtrate may abſolve a man after he hath ſatisfied for his crime in the civil court, though the ſame man ſhould ſtand condemned in the ſpirituall court. When the ſentences are ſo directly contrary, and yet the judicatures
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:123664:85"/> do not enterfear, nor at all meddle nor make one with another, theſe muſt be acknowledged courts of a different nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The caſe propounded maketh nothing againſt me, nor for a juriſdiction (of presbyteries, claſſes and ſynods, to depoſe, excommunicate, and make lawes authoritatively) independent and diſtinct from the magiſtrate; which is the hinge of all our controverſie.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Properly miniſters do not abſolve or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, neither are they otherwiſe pardoners then ſaviours; but only upon the demonſtrations of repentance, they do declare pardon of ſins, and remiſſion either paſt or to come. For I do not enter into a controverſy betwixt Rever. and learned Mr. Baxter (whom I give thanks for his kind uſage and civilities) and my ſelf, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther repentance goeth before remiſſion or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth it: but however, the miniſter doth no further forgive, then in declaring that God ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath forgiven ſins already, or will forgive them. So that he, neither pardoning nor ſealing forgiveneſſe of ſins, can have no judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie or judgement.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I never denied the two courts diſtinctly ſet down Rom. 13. one is the power of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, to which we are ſubject for wrath, the other that to which we are ſubject for conſcience ſake. In this latter God hath ſet up a tribunall, wherein the conſcience paſſeth ſentence either of condemnation or of abſolution. The ſentences
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:123664:86"/> paſſed in theſe two courts have no conflict; which cannot be ſaid of the ſentences paſſed in presbyteries, which many times are oppoſed and reverſed by the magiſtrate: but the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates condemning is no hinderance to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience from paſſing a ſentence of abſolution, either for the fact committed, or for other ſins.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Neither is the miniſter a judge whether the condemned perſon is penitent or no, but the conſcience of the man is, which more properly is the judge that abſolveth or condemneth: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the miniſter furniſheth evidences, helping the man to plead guilty or not guilty.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The paſtor comforting or rowzing up the priſoner, doth diſcharge the part of a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger, and not the part of a judge in a court: for he is no judge of a man, who leaveth him to the judgement of another, as doth the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The nature of a court is, not to condemn upon ſuppoſition that the priſoner knoweth himſelf guilty; but abſolutely to condemn that perſon whom the judge and jury have a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular knowledge to be guilty: and ſuch is the nature of the court of conſcience, when it juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth only where it knoweth it ſelf clear, and condemneth where it is conſcious of its guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. But no paſtour hath a particular know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of any perſons evidences for heaven, but what he gathereth by outward ſignes; and ſo all
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:123664:86"/> acts of his, either of abſolution or of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, are meerly upon ſuppoſition, and no acts of a judge, and therefore no acts of a court. In ſhort, both a court of magiſtrates and a court of conſcience, in abſolving or condemning, know what they do; but the paſtor knoweth not, God only knowing it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The action of a paſtour abſolving is no act of court, but an act of the ſame nature with the preaching of the Goſpell, by which pardon is pronounced to all that truly repent, and lay hold on Chriſt by faith.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The party arraigned in a true court, (ſuch is the court of the magiſtrate and that of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience) is diſmiſſed clear or guilty, as the judge of the court ſhall pronounce: but none can be guilty or not guilty, and ſtand or fall, as the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſhall verbally pronounce; there being here no concurrence of any act of his, but that of the ſpirit in the word by his miniſtery.</p>
               <p n="8">8. This arraigned perſon, who is neceſſitated to under go the ſentence of the magiſtrate either for abſolution or condemnation, hath no ſuch neceſſity to go to the church or paſtour, except he hath perſonally offended ſome of them, or oweth them mony: in which caſe his reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation is no appearance in any court; only a brother or a creditour may pardon him his debt or offence, that is, pray God to forgive him. Here there is no footſtep of juriſdiction of either par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on the other: but in caſe the party arraigned
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:123664:87"/> ſeeks to be reconciled to God, none being able to make his peace with God but God himſelf, nor to declare peace, but the teſtimony of his conſcience; the paſtour may help to clear his evidences, and ſo may any godly gifted bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and well read in the Scripture; but neither of them properly judgeth him, or maketh his peace, neither is here any juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The nature of a court is to have power and juriſdiction over thoſe that are unwilling, as Jeſus Chriſt ſaith to St. Peter.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:123664:87"/> to that end he muſt appoint miniſters; and if they will not be employed about that work, or in caſe they do it amiſſe, I ſay, he may inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his power and authority: and ſo ſay moſt of the Divines, that if the miniſter do not diſcharge his place in all its functions and acts, that the magiſtrate ought to enjoyn him to do it.

What he alſo ſaith, that the magiſtrates of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice doth not extend to the care of ſouls, may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be queſtioned: for the contrary is proved by Scripture, and the authority of moſt Fathers and Divines.

But though the office of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate ſhould not extend to the care of ſouls, yet this doth not conclude a church-judicature diſtinct from that of the magiſtrate: for neither
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:123664:88"/> doth the magiſtrate meddle with the phyſitians office in curing diſeaſes, or look to the health of horſes and other cattle: every office hath its ſeverall care, but not its ſeverall juriſdiction.</p>
               <p n="12">12. This may be alſo queſtioned, that the Conſiſtory is not to meddle with the ſentence of the magiſtrate: for if he cleareth the nocent, and condemneth the innocent, he hath as much to do with him as with the pooreſt wretch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to die; he muſt tell him, as John told Herod, <hi>it is not lawfull for thee to do that,</hi> and cry abomination to him. There is no action of the magiſtrate, no ſentence or judgement of his, wherein there is either right or wrong, but falls within the cognizance and reprehenſion of the miniſter.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Briefly, in the caſe propounded, there is not the leaſt footſtep of juriſdiction or court, no citing, no witneſſes, no plaintiff, no defendant, ſentence, condemnation, abſolution, ſergeant, gaole, executioner, all conditions neceſſarie in every judicatorie; not ſo much as one of them is found in the court of Mr. Calandrin. 1. They do not cite the party; they entreat him to come: if he will not come, they have no remedy, they cannot compell him. 2. They have no witneſſes, nor evidences of the caſe, and therefore cannot pronounce ſentence. 3. The abſolution muſt be null, when they do not know whether it ſhall ſtand. 4. Neither do they know whether God will not abſolve whom they condemn. 5. They

I ſhall willingly admit two courts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I have ſpoken largely in my <hi>Paraeneſis,</hi> one called <hi>forum externum,</hi> the externall court or the court of magiſtracy, which is to be found in ſome meaſure of power in all aſſemblies and ſocieties of men, as churches, ſynods, presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, families, ſchools, colledges, corporations, &amp;c. and the other called <hi>forum internum,</hi> or the court of the conſcience. 1. In this God hath ſet a tribunall, a judge, a witneſſe, a plaintiff and defendant. 2. In that all is carried by outward evidences, whether in a ſynod, presbyterie, or any other court. 3. In that there is an obligation of active or paſſive obedience to the laws, decrees and ordinances that have the ſanction of a law, whether juſt or unjuſt. 4. In this obedience is due for conſcience ſake, and in obedience to God, to lawes, ordinances, and commands, either of God or of men, that are by the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of approbation &amp; diſcretion apprehended to be good, juſt and holy. 5. In this there is a ſtronger ſtreſſe of obligation laid then in that; ſo that, as we ought rather to obey God then men, a man is obliged notwithſtanding all the ſanction of the magiſtrate, to appeal from the court of the magiſtrate to that of the conſcience, and to yield no obedience to any lawes, injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions or commands of magiſtrates, paſtours,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:123664:89"/> ſynods, presbyteries, churches, till after they have been there reviewed and approved of. There being but theſe two courts and juriſdictions, in the caſe propounded by Mr. Calandrin, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter cannot be judge in another mans court or conſcience; and in that court I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive he would put a greater tye, then the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate doth upon any man, as to bind him not to appeal from his judgement to the court of his own conſcience, or at leaſt not to remove the cauſe &amp; judgement of the miniſters court to his own court. Neither is the miniſter judge in the other court, except by a delegated power from the magiſtrate, or by an aſſirmed power of magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy, binding either to active or paſſive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; neither from that court, do I think that Mr. Calandrin would bind a man not to appeal to the court of his conſcience.</p>
               <p n="15">15. To draw to a concluſion; in the caſe propounded by Mr. Calandrin, we have acts of function, but none otherwiſe of juriſdiction then in the function of a phyſitian; whom in relation to his ſick patient, either being alone, or ſitting in a colledge among his brethren, I might make to exerciſe a juriſdiction diſtinct from that of the magiſtrate, and parallel the phyſitian with the paſtor, the patient with the penitent, the colledge of phyſitians with the conſiſtory, the curing of the patient with the abſolving of the penitent, and ſo make the caſe propounded in the behalf of eccleſiaſticall juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:123664:89"/> applyable to the medicall juriſdiction, changing only the perſons. Yes I might ſhew, that a parallel being made, the medicall would outvie the eccleſiaſticall, as being leſſe inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the nature of juriſdiction, and more diſtinct from that of the magiſtrate. For 1. the magiſtrates office extendeth more to the care of ſouls then to that of bodies: 2. Phyſitians more properly cure diſeaſes, then miniſters pardon ſins: 3. Phyſitians judgements of the nature of diſeaſes are more certain and evident, then the miniſters judgements of grace and repentance; and therefore their ſentences are more perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. I might inſtance in more particulars; at leaſt I could ſo match both juriſdictions, as to make them alike diſtinct from that of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Calandrin in a poſtſcript giveth ſeverall exceptions againſt what I have ſaid in my <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeneſis,</hi> of the two courts. He ſaith, <hi>I do not deny that conſcience may be called a court im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly:</hi> neither do I ſay that it hath all the properties of a court of magiſtracy; but it hath the neceſſary conditions required in a court: and that name it hath by the common conſent of all Divines, Philoſophers, ſchool-men, heathens, Papiſts and Proteſtants, none doubting of it; whereas many have queſtioned whether there be any ſuch thing as <hi>forum eccleſiaſticum;</hi> and none of thoſe that admitted ſuch a <hi>forum</hi> or eccleſiaſticall court, but, as they have confeſſed
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:123664:90"/> that eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction is improperly ſo called, ſo have they thought no leſſe of an ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall court.</p>
               <p>He alſo findeth fault with me for ſaying, that excommunication was no act of eccleſiaſticall power, becauſe exerciſed in the court of man; and ſaith, <hi>Is not preaching as much an act of the externall court as excommunication, when both are done alike with words outwardly?</hi> I grant that the preaching of the word is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall act, performed by outward moving of the lips, and lifting up the voice; and ſo all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward actions of men, as buying, ſelling, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſtriking with a hammer, eating, drinking, and the like; which are ſaid to be performed in the court of man, not becauſe they are juridicall acts, but becauſe they are the ſubject and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not only of ſuits and controverſies depending on the court of man, but alſo of lawes and orders made in the ſame court: as if a man preached not at all, or preached amiſſe, and erroneouſly or ſeditiouſly, that act of his may create an action in the externall court of man; ſo may all other actions I have named; as if one ſell another mans wares unknown to him, if he walks in an undue place, and time, if he ſtrikes his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with a hammer; and ſo one may make an induction of all actions of men, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe are no forinſecall acts, but are either natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, morall actions, or acts of function, and not of juriſdiction: as in a phyſitian, to cure
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:123664:90"/> the ſick, in a ſea-man, to ſet his ſhip to ſail, in a merchant, to vend his wares, and ſo in a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, to do the acts of his function; all which are actions performed outwardly in the court of man, albeit they be not forinſecall. And by reaſon that excommunication is an outward act, it is done in the court of man, as well as buying, ſelling and walking; and beſides it is a forinſecall and juridicall act, binding men to outward obedience, either actively or paſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and of the ſame nature with other juridicall acts in the courts of men: but ſuch an act preaching of the word is not, binding none to outward obedience, except he be firſt inwardly convinced, though it may fall out to be the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and matter handled in a forinſecall court, as well as buying and ſelling, which are no forinſecall acts, as excommunicating is. Thus Mr. Calandrin ſees, 1. that it is very conſiſtent that a thing or action be done in the <hi>forum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternum,</hi> and yet not be an act or action of that <hi>forum;</hi> 2. that preaching need not to be an action of that <hi>forum,</hi> for that it is performed outwardly, as well as excommunication.</p>
               <p>It may be (for I have not now my <hi>Paraeneſis</hi> by me) I referred the preaching of the Goſpell to the <hi>forum internum,</hi> or the court of conſcience; which I did, not in regard of the outward act, but of the preaching to the heart, and of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of outward preaching, as believing, loving, truſting, all which are performed in the court of conſcience.</p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:123664:91"/>
               <p>This ſerves for anſwer to what he ſaith next, <hi>If the key of the word, for all it hath externall acts, may nevertheleſſe belong to the</hi> forum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternum, <hi>why may not the key of cenſure as well? ſince both are alike in relation to the ſoul and the inward man.</hi> The handling of the key of the word, as it is outwardly pronounced, is an act not of juriſdiction, but of function, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the <hi>forum externum;</hi> but as it is a preaching to the heart, it is an act performed in the <hi>forum internum,</hi> or the court of conſcience: but the handling of the key of cenſure is an act of juriſdiction over the outward man, however the inward man be affected, and compelling to an outward obedience; and therefore belongeth not to the <hi>forum internum,</hi> in which ſuch acts as preaching to the heart, loving, believing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying ones ſelf, are performed.</p>
               <p>What he ſaith, that <hi>both the key of the word and of cenſure have relation to the ſoul and the inward man,</hi> proveth not that excommunication is not an externall act of an externall juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For an act of outward juriſdiction in the <hi>forum externum,</hi> may produce a good effect in the <hi>forum internum,</hi> even in the ſoul of a man: ſuch effect may excommunicationbring forth, though it be an act of magiſtracy and outward juriſdiction; ſo may the laying hold of a malefactour, and the ſentence of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate paſſ't upon him, be a ſoveraign remedy for the ſalvation of his ſoul, and be nevertheleſſe
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:123664:91"/> an act of magiſtracy &amp; of the <hi>forum externum.</hi> In ſhort, there being but two courts conceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, one externall, the other internall, this of the conſcience, the other of magiſtracy; I know no <hi>medium</hi> between them two, no more then betwixt command and counſell, and betwixt the power of the word and the power of the ſword.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the nature of calling to the miniſtery. Miniſters are not called by men, but by God, by a ſucceſſion not of ordination, but providence. The plea for ſucceſſion is Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſh. Miniſters are no ſucceſſours in their miniſtery to the Iudaicall Prieſts, but to the Prophets.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SInce no religion can ſtand without a church, and meetings of Chriſtians about Divine worſhip, and no church without government, and no government without governours, which the Rever. Aſſembly calls church-officers, and no governours without a commanding power and a rule to govern others by; it will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to enquire into four things; 1. the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the church-officers; 2. the extent of their power, and of the obedience due to them;
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:123664:92"/> 3. whether all church-officers are inveſted with the power of the keyes, and of binding and looſing, as the Rever. Aſſembly ſeemeth to ſay; 4. by what rule and diſcipline they are to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For the calling of miniſters, I have han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled that ſubject at large in my <hi>Paraeneſis.</hi> I make the calling to be as much of divine autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as the reverend Miniſters of London do in their <hi>jus Divinum</hi> of the miniſtery, yea more; holding, that they have no call from men, but from God immediatly; that their miſſion is from Chriſt and the Apoſtles; that all the acts of church-miniſters, people, and magiſtrate about receiving a miniſter, are not to ſend him, but to acknowledge Gods call and miſſion, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blickly to declare their willingneſſe and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to accept of his miniſtery among them: for all theſe following acts are neceſſarily to be ſuppoſed, before a man be acknowledged a Miniſter of the Goſpell, and ſet apart by God for the great work of ſaving ſouls.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The acts of his internall calling, or rather his diſpoſition: which are a ſtrong deſire and reſolution to conſecrate his life, time and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that he may be a miniſter of the Goſpell; and a perſuaſion that he is by God thereunto called.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The acts which doe make up his externall calling, and by which men acknowledge Gods call, are, 1. an examen (by a competent number of grave, pious and learned miniſters) of him
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:123664:92"/> that intends to take the miniſtery upon himſelf; of his parts, abilities, learning, doctrine; alſo of his life and converſation; which they muſt teſtifie publickly, whereby it may appear to all, that they hold him every way fit to labour in the word and doctrine. 2. The election of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular church, requiring his pains amongſt them, and deſiring him to be their ordinary pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor and teacher, to adminiſter unto them the ordinances of the word and ſacraments.</p>
               <p>This act, though it hath much of humane right, and ſeemeth to depend on mans will and choice; yet in a right-conſtituted church, and in an aſſembly of good men met in the name of Chriſt, there is much of Gods call concurring with the choice made by men. Thus Ezech. 33. at the beginning, God declareth by his Prophet, that whatever watchman the people ſhould chuſe, he would repute that choice to be his act, in that he would puniſh thoſe that ſhould ſlight the admonitions of the watchman, and did not take them for Gods warnings, and would take an account of the watchman for his failing in the care of mens ſouls. Which place of Ezechiel doth much confirm what I have ſaid chapt. 2. of the nature of right; where I ſhewed, that things that are of Divine right may be ſaid alſo to be of humane right, and things that are of humane right to be alſo of Divine right. This obſervation I have from my precious and learned friend Mr. <hi>Sadler;</hi> and much might a man ſay upon
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:123664:93"/> it, to ſhew that as in the adminiſtration of the church of the Jewes, ſo in that of the Chriſtians, Divine and humane right, government, lawes, injunctions, commands, go along together, without needing to be parted into two coordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate diſtinct claſſes of juriſdiction, the one ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall, diſtinct and independent from the other which they call civil. One may alſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſee, that much labour is loſt in aſſerting the <hi>jus Divinum</hi> of the miniſtery, as if it had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of humane right, or as if a call from men were not alſo a Divine call. For if magiſtrate and people ſhould chuſe themſelves a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man over their own ſouls, to divide the word unto them, why ſhould not this act be reputed a Divine choice, and a Divine inſtalling in the call, as well as the choice of the watch-man whereof mention is made in Ezechiel?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third act towards the making up the externall call, is a publick licence to exerciſe the miniſtery whereunto he is called by the voice of God, the choice of the people, and the publick teſtimony of other miniſters. This act of giving licence, being an act of juriſdiction, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed under an orthodox magiſtracy by the magiſtrate himſelf; but under an heterodox or heathen magiſtracy, by the keepers of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate diſcipline, who ſupply the place of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy.</p>
               <p>The 4. act is, a ſolemn begging of God a bleſſing by the miniſters met in a <hi>coetus,</hi> preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:123664:93"/> or ſynod, or otherwiſe, by prayer and faſting, upon the reſolution of the party that is to take the miniſtery upon him, the choice of the church, and the licence of the magiſtrate. This action may be performed with laying on of hands; a rite which may be uſed for decency and ornament, not for neceſſity, as if the calling was null without it: and ſo Muſculus, Bullin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerus, Gualterus, Martyr, and Meſtrezat, late reverend Paſtour at Paris, all tell us.</p>
               <p>I know of no miniſteriall ordination, but that which is performed this way; and it is much like for the nature of it to Gods making man and wife: to the doing whereof there is no concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of a miniſter or miniſters requiſite, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to begge a bleſſing upon the man and the woman that intend to joyn themſelves in the ſtate of matrimony: in which action the miniſter contributes no more to the integrity of it, then his grace before dinner doth to make it a meal; though I confeſſe there is more in the prayer of a miniſter towards the perfecting of the laſt act of miniſtery, then in his prayer before the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of matrimonie, or before a meal. For I ſhould think any miniſters call null before men, that was not firſt bleſſed by a ſolemn prayer, and a conſecrating to God both of the miniſters and people. I have been induced to believe, that ordination is completed by theſe 4. acts; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 1. I find it moſt agreeable with the word; 2. by them the calling is no leſſe, if not more
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:123664:94"/> of Divine authority, for this way there is as much caution againſt thoſe that enter into the miniſtery by the window, and not by the door, as is obſerved in Sion Colledge. I make not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the miniſtery to be as much of divine inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the reverend miniſters of London in their <hi>jus Divinum</hi> of the miniſtery; but beſides, I make the miniſters call to be wholly divine, and receiving nothing from or by men; which the reverend miniſters do not: for as men do not inſtitute miniſtery, ſo neither miniſters; it is with them both as with the doctrine of a preacher, which we trye whether it be from God or men, but we give no authority to it. And as beſides in ward evidences, by which we diſcern a divine wiſedome in the Scripture, we have ſome outward marks and teſtimonies which make it currant to be of divine authority, even among thoſe that do not believe: ſo may we ſay of the call of every miniſter; which neither other miniſters nor the people make either to be a call, or a divine call: only by what they ſee of the man by his life and doctrine, and by thoſe mentioned conditions required in all thoſe that God hath inwardly called, they no way doubt but whom God hath called inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he alſo will call them outwardly without any act of man, but to render a teſtimony to Gods call: which teſtimony is given partly by the party himſelf, approving himſelf to all men; partly by other markers, the choice of the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:123664:94"/> church, and the licence of the magiſtrate. 3. By that methode we anſwer, without any difficulty, the Papiſts queſtion, how reformed miniſters came by their calling, and what ſucceſſion they have; which tye of ſucceſſion is laid upon the presbyterian ordination; which will be eaſily proved void and null, if the ſucceſſion hath been never ſo little interrupted; at which time if we have recourſe to Gods immediate call and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, as the 31. article of the confeſſion of the reformed churches in France hath, attributing more to the miſſion of God then to that of men; what inconvenience is it to give the ſame glory to God at all times, and as well at one as at another; and to hold, that God hath no other ſucceſſion then that of his providence, that God and the miniſtery are more magnified, if mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters receive their office immediatly from God, then by the hands of men? what need we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſalve and make up a lineal ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion interrupted by this ſhift of neceſſity, the which if it gives more glory to God, it may be well converted into a neceſſity not to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it? For doubtleſſe this plea of ſucceſſion ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all ordinations valid, is a rank Romiſh one, and very ſtrongly aſſerting, if admitted by us reformed, that there is no viſible church but the Roman. For if it be granted to them, that as there is no church without miniſtery, ſo no miniſtery without ordination, and no ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation without lineall ſucceſſion from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles;
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:123664:95"/> they will eaſily prove that ſucceſſion failing, the ordination hath alſo failed, and with it the miniſtery, and ſo the church; which can never recover a being, without a ſucceſſion be ſhewed from the Apoſtles downward; as the Veſtall virgins, when their fire was out, did not kindle it at the fire of men, but of God. 4. It ſerves to remove an old miſtake, that the miniſters of the Goſpell are ſucceſſours to the Prieſts and Levites; whereas they have rather ſucceeded the Prophets. It is true, the Preiſts and Levites were alſo Prophets, as they were keepers of the law, and were to read and expound the Scripture, and in that office I grant the miniſters of the Goſpell have ſucceeded them: but in that the propheticall office was not continued in all thoſe that were only prophets by a lineall ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of ordination, but meerly by a ſucceſſion of the providence of God, who never left him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without witneſſes, Seers and Prophets, whom he raiſed not by any call of man, but of God; no doubt but now God calleth the miniſters, the true Prophets of the new Teſtament, by the ſame ſucceſſion and ordination of providence, not by a creation and inſtalling by man. That the miniſters of the Goſpell did not ſucceed the priefthood, it is manifeſt; for that being rituall &amp; typicall, ended in Jeſus Chriſt, there remaining only the propheticall office common to the prophets both under the old and under the new Teſtament: to which firſt (which I note by
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:123664:95"/> the way, and it is much materiall to our preſent purpoſe, and the main argument of the book) as no juriſdiction was annexed under the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the old Teſtament, but what they had over the uncircumciſed in heart; ſo neither is it convenient the miniſters of the Goſpell ſhould have any other.</p>
               <p>This being the nature of miniſteriall calling, or ordination (if a man will call it ſo) and no ſuperinduction of character, power, duty, gift or licence being conferred by the ordaining miniſters; ſo neither is there any thing taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by any act of theirs, of depoſition or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auctoration; only every one withdraweth his feather, protection and countenance: the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate withdraweth his licence; the miniſters ſay, they will not hereafter hold him a fellow and partner in the work of the Goſpell with them; the people declare their diſlike of the man, and profeſſe they will make uſe no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his miniſtery; which act is no more an act of juriſdiction, then the refuſing to take phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick is an act of juriſdiction over the phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.</p>

               <p>NExt we are to conſider the nature and extent of the power of the miniſters of the Goſpell, wholly the ſame with that the Prophets under the old Teſtament had; a power not forcing the body, but enlightening the underſtanding, and convincing the heart, ruling the affections, and bringing them captive to the obedience of the croſſe. A power which the new Teſtament men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in a hundred places, either in the ſame words, or in equivalent terms, and yet never ſo much as once underſtandeth by it a presbyterian ſynodicall or eccleſiaſticall power, of depoſing, excommunicating, and of making lawes and canons authoritatively; but alwayes meaneth the vertue and efficacy of the ſpirit of God in the word and miniſtery, called the power of God Rom. 1. v. 16. 1 Cor. 1. v. 14. and chap. 2. v. 5. and chap. 4. v. 19, 20.

               <p>I know of no other power of binding and looſing, no other keyes of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven committed to the church-officers: though pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſpeaking, the keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven, and the power of binding and looſing, are not committed to miniſters as the word is, but as the ſpirit is in the word; ſo that it is not
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:123664:97"/> the miniſters, but the word that bears the keyes; the opening of the heart with thoſe keyes as it is only the work of the ſpirit, ſo is it known only to the ſpirit of God in the heart of man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced and converted, and not to the miniſter himſelf, who only apprehendeth his office of being the word-bearer, but is not ſenſible of its efficacy and workings.</p>
               <p>Amyraldus <hi>theſ.</hi> 10. <hi>de</hi> 5. <hi>falſo dictis ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis</hi> ſaith, that the power of binding and looſing did only belong to the Apoſtles, and that that power conſiſted in three particulars: 1. that being led by an unerring ſpirit, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever in revealing the myſtery of the Goſpell they preached, and approved for ſound do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, was to be received with like credit as if it had been delivered by Chriſt himſelf, and whatever they ſaid was amiſs or falſe, was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be taken as if it had been pronounced ſo in Heaven: &amp; this, ſaith he, is according to the Hebrew Idiome, to bind and to looſe: 2. in inflicting corporall puniſhments and vexation by Satan upon thoſe that diſhonoured Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: 3. in freeing thoſe that were delivered to Satan upon their repentance, and forgiving their ſins. He is yet much more expreſſe and diffuſe upon this ſubject; but I ſtudy brevity, which makes me I do not here inſert his own words in Latin; but however he ſaith enough to undermine the foundation upon which the presbyterians build their excommunication,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:123664:97"/> which hitherto being mainly ſupported by that power of binding and looſing, and the two chief ſtayes, namely this place of Matth. 18. of binding and looſing, and that of the inceſtuous perſon 1 Cor. 5. failing, there now remaineth but a poor ſingle crutch to draw along excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, cut out of theſe words, <hi>tell it unto the church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Lightfoot, an exceeding learned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Divine, giveth a very probable expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the power of looſing and binding, in his Harmony Matth. 16. which doubtleſſe doth car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in it more ſolidity and weight then the vulgar explication given by the Reverend Aſſembly and others, of the power of cenſuring, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating and abſolving. He ſaith, that the power of binding and looſing was given only to the Apoſtles, as far as ſome part of Moſes law was to ſtand in practiſe, and ſome to be laid aſide; ſome things under the law prohibited were now to be permitted, and ſome things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be now prohibited: ſo that in theſe words, <hi>whatſoever,</hi> &amp;c. Chriſt promiſeth to the Apoſtles ſuch an aſſiſtance of his ſpirit, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them ſuch a power, that what they allowed to ſtand in practiſe ſhould ſtand, and what to fall, ſhould fall; in ſhort, what they bound on earth ſhould be bound in heaven. And that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is the more receivable, becauſe the Greek text ſpeaks not of binding or looſing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but things, ſaying, not, whomſoever you
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:123664:98"/> ſhall bind, but whatſoever things ye ſhall bind, &amp;c. that is, whatſoever things ye ſhall diſpenſe with or oblige unto.</p>
               <p>He alſo on the 1 Cor. 5. parallels this place of binding and looſing to Joh. 20. v. 22. <hi>whoſe ſins yea retain, they are retained,</hi> &amp;c. and ſaith, that that power was a peculiar gift to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, when Chriſt breathed on them, by which they ſpoke ſtrange tongues, healed diſeaſes, killed and made alive, delivered up to Satan, and beſtowed the holy Ghoſt, or the power to work the ſame miracles. Which expoſition ſtrengtheneth the precedent, which is but a branch and an effect of that miraculous power conferred on the Apoſtles. For by the ſame power of miracles, or of binding and looſing, whereby they delivered to Satan, and healed diſeaſes, they alſo preſcribed how far ſome rites of Moſes were diſpenſable.</p>
               <p>We have then three expoſitions of the words of Chriſt, <hi>whatſoever ye ſhall bind,</hi> &amp;c. none of which make for a presbyterian excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but contrarily they deſtroy it: for all theſe three expoſitions are ſutable to the literall and myſticall meaning, which is abſolute and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out condition; Chriſt promiſing to bind and looſe in heaven whatſoever ſhall be bound and looſed on earth: whereas thoſe that expound that place of binding and looſing of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, are forced to put a condition to the abſolute words of Chriſt, telling us, that they
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:123664:98"/> muſt be underſtood <hi>clave non errante,</hi> in caſe there is no errour in him that excommunicates. And therefore Beza againſt Eraſtus and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, fearing the many inconveniences and abſurdities that follow upon the literall ſenſe, that Gods binding and looſing in heaven ſhould ſteer according to the binding and looſing on earth by excommunication and abſolution, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds the words of Chriſt as if he had ſaid, whatſoever ſhall be bound and looſed in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhall alſo be bound and looſed on earth, that is, the miniſter excommunicating on earth doth but declare what God hath already done in heaven; which is the opinion of ſome ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, namely of Dominicus à Soto lib. 4. diſt. 14. qu. 1. art. 3. ſaying, that the words, <hi>ego te ligo, I excommunicate thee,</hi> are equivalent to theſe, <hi>I declare that God hath already excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated thee.</hi> But I think this expoſition is cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered with more abſurdities then the vulgar. 1. Who knoweth the mind of God? 2. and whether he hath excommunicated from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or from the outward communion? ſurely not from the inward, for then excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould not be a ſoul-ſaving ordinance, as the Rever. Aſſembly tell us; nor from the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, this being an act of man, not of God; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept one ſay that the miniſter outwardly acted, what in his ſecret counſell he hath decreed: but ſtill the difficulty will be, how the miniſter is acquainted with Gods ſecret and not revealed
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:123664:99"/> will; and if he be acquainted with it, how can an outward action, in which the paſtor may erre, be a conſequent of an unerring ſentence of God?</p>
               <p>But however the power of the keyes and of binding and looſing is to be underſtood, the new Teſtament ſpeaketh of governments in the church, and of ruling and rulers, and it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth the faithfull to obey thoſe that rule over them; and St. Paul biddeth Timothy not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive lightly an accuſation againſt an elder. So farre then the word of God alloweth a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment diſtinct from that of the magiſtrate, and endoweth the miniſters of the Goſpell with a power of ruling and governing. But this power is neither of the nature of the magiſtrates power, nor of that they call eccleſiaſticall, which we have proved to be wholly the ſame with the magiſtrates power. This power of the miniſters ruling and governing is ſomething like that power that Princes and maſters of heathen ſchools had over their diſciples, ſcholars and auditors, as Plato, Zeno, Ariſtotle; who had a great power over their minds, but no juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction over their bodies, eſtates and outward li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties: it is true, they kept them in awe, reſpect and obedience; but it was a voluntary ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to their precepts, like that of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the great to the commands of the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</p>
               <p>This being the miniſteriall power in a ſhadow,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:123664:99"/> it is more expreſſely ſet down in the Scripture: and no doubt that power is the nobleſt power and greateſt power in the univerſe, next to that of creating and redeeming the world; a power that the Son of God had and managed in this world: none have ſuch warrant of authority, as to be Ambaſſadours from Chriſt; none have ſuch an errand: there is no tye of obedience like that to their commands. But ſtill this mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall power, commands and authority, and the obedience due to them, are not of the nature of the power and obedience obſerved in churches or magiſtrates judicatories. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. The magiſtrates and churches judicatories do not only enjoyn the commands of God, but alſo their own: but the miniſters of the Goſpells power is only to deliver what they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the Lord, 1 Cor. 11. even Moſes, Deut. 4. v. 5. acknowledgeth that he taught nothing but what God enjoyned him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Accordingly a member of a church doth not obey the word of his Paſtor, but of God, Col. 2. v. 22. Marc. 7. v. 7. 1 John 3. v. 24. &amp; chap. 5. v. 3. When the paſtor hath no command of the Lord, as 1 Cor. 7. v. 25. then he delivers his own judgement and counſell; and that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell a church-member hath no command to obey; though he ought to have diſcretion and condeſcenſion enough to follow it, if he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it tends to mutuall edification. Yet in a church conſtituted, there being need of a power
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:123664:100"/> of magiſtracy, either delegated or aſſumed, by a confederate diſcipline, and a magiſtrate-like juriſdiction being ſet up in his congregation, he ought, as every church-member, even when he apprehendeth no tye to obey the paſtors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand as Gods command, to obey, by an obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience either active or paſſive, the commands of that magiſtrate which himſelf hath elected, when by a joint conſent they all agreed upon a form of diſcipline.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Church-judicatories, if they make any lawes, decrees, or reſolve upon a cenſure to be inflicted upon a church-member, they require obedience and ſubmiſſion, without arguing or diſputing the caſe, or having the liberty either to yield to them, or to decline them if they liſt: But the true paſtorall power commandeth only underſtanding, free and wiſe men, that are able to judge, 1 Cor. 10 v. 15. like thoſe of Beroea, who ſo hearkened to the voice of St. Paul, that ere they obeyed it, they conſulted the Scripture, to know whether it were ſo as he taught them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The eccleſiaſticall presbyteriall power, like that of the magiſtrate, requireth obedience to its lawes, ordinances and decrees, not becauſe they are good, juſt and equitable, but becauſe it ſo pleaſed the law-givers; for a man excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated never ſo unjuſtly is to ſubmit to the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the ſentence, &amp; not to the equity, which, as our brethren and Mr. Gilleſpie teach us,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:123664:100"/> is not in the breaſt of the party judged, but of the judge: But the true miniſteriall power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth no obedience to its commands, but of ſuch as are perſwaded or convinced of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, truth and equity of the law and ſentence. The Greek <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifieth both to believe, be perſwaded, &amp; to obey; which intimateth that he truly performeth the paſtorall commands, who believeth in the name of the Lord Jeſus: for this is the main commandement of Chriſt; as the next is, that we ſhould love one another. Such commands are not obeyed by the motion of the body, but by that of the heart and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. The power of magiſtracy commandeth the hand to give almes to the poor, but the power of the miniſter commandeth to give them with a ready mind; one commandeth the gift, the other charity and a diſpoſition ſutable to the giver. The magiſtrate ſetteth a day of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but the paſtor commandeth the ſetting of the heart apart from the world.</p>
               <p>All this ſerves to anſwer all the arguments of Mr. Gilleſpie, drawn from one and twenty places of Scripture, in the belief of his eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>The place 1 Tim. 5. v. 19. <hi>againſt an elder,</hi> &amp;c. he much urgeth: but the following verſe ſheweth that in that context there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a church-judicatory, where men are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, witneſſes confronted and heard, and a judiciall ſentence pronounced. It is the duty
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:123664:101"/> of paſtors to reprove ſin and ſinners privately, if the offence be private, and publickly and in an open aſſembly, if the ſin be committed in the face of the church, and to the ſcandall of all: and yet S. Paul giveth a good caveat, that the paſtor of the church ſhould not lightly ayme at and point at any man, ſpecially an elder, and give credit to rumours, but be throughly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. This rebuke is no excommunication, nor a denouncing of church cenſure, but of the judgements of God.</p>
               <p>But were there any ſuch thing in St. Pauls time as a church-judicatory, judicious and learned Mr. Lightfoot will tell Mr. Gilleſpie, that it were no inconveniency to ſay, that even in St. Pauls time Chriſtian churches being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delled after the platform of Jewiſh ſynagogues, beſides miniſtery in them, had alſo magiſtracy; and that it were neither improbable nor irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall to interpret the place 1 Tim. 5. v. 17. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that rule. See him on the 5. of the 1. Cor. in his Harmony. Which being granted, the 19. verſe will very well admit the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation. But let us take a generall view of all the 21. arguments of Mr. Gilleſpie.</p>
               <p>If it be poſſible for any man to make ſomething of nothing, Mr. Gilleſpie hath that art; for he thinks all is fiſh that comes to his net: like the Papiſts, who if they do but read of fire, of a pot, of a valley, of a ditch, it is enough for them there to find purgatory. Thus Mr. Gilleſpie, where
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:123664:101"/> he findeth the words <hi>reject, rebuke, beware, take heed, flee, note, put away, withdraw, weapon, ſword,</hi> there he will be ſure to have presbyteriall juriſdiction and power of excommunicating. Who would think that Galat. 5. v. 12. <hi>I would they were even cut off which trouble you,</hi> could ſerve his turn? and yet he beſtows three pages in ſtriking excommunication out of this flint. That noble paſſage 2 Cor. 10. 4, &amp;c. where the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall weapons are lively ſet out, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth of excommunication p. 292. and in verſe 6. <hi>and having in readineſſe to revenge all diſobedience,</hi> he findeth eccleſiaſticall power and cenſure, no leſſe then that of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. But of all places, I much wonder he can paraphraſe 2 Cor. 2. 8. for eccleſiaſticall power and excommunication. <hi>I beſeech you that you would confirm your love towards him;</hi> that is, as Mr. Gilleſpie expoundeth p. 290. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you to ſhew your judiciall power in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving the inceſtuous man from the ſentence of excommunication. Of the ſame weight is that proof of eccleſiaſticall power and excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation out of Revel. 2. v. 14. and 20. where he ſaith, the church of Pergamus is cenſured for not cenſuring, that is for not excommunicating the woman Jezebel. Tis a wonder he doth not make the very cenſuring of the church of Pergamus to be excommunication. Such proofs ſometimes fall from the moſt eminent of them: as when the Rever. Aſſembly, to prove a government of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:123664:102"/> church-officers diſtinct from the civil magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, alledgeth in the margin Eſaias 9. v. 6, 7. meerly becauſe the word government is there mentioned; for without that, the place that ſpeaketh of Gog and Magog had been as valid an argument for a church-government and for excommunication, as that of Eſaias, where it is meerly intended to deſcribe the Godhead of Chriſt, the aſſumption of humane nature, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> gloriouſneſſe and ſtrength of his ſpirituall and myſticall kingdom.</p>
               <p>Yet truſt I needs ſay thus much of the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Aſſembly, that in grounding the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of church-officers upon that place of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaias, they have followed the ſenſe of all their presbyterian brethren; who making two powers of the keyes, one of ſcience, of which Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaks Luc. 11. v. 52. and another of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, under which they comprehend the power of cenſuring, excommunicating, and making lawes <hi>authoritatively;</hi> they have no other authority for it then this place of Eſaias, and another Apocaly p. 3. 7. where Chriſt is ſaid to have the key of David, with which as he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth &amp; no man ſhutteth, ſo he ſhutteth &amp; no man openeth: which place, in my opinion, is no ſtronger a plea for an eccleſiaſticall and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall government placed in the hands of church officers, then the place of Eſaias alledged by the Rever. Aſſembly; for this place, as well as the other, as Beza noteth upon Revel. 3. 7.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:123664:102"/> ſpeaketh of the myſticall Kingdom of Chriſt that hath no end, of which Luc. 1. v. 32. &amp; 33. but of this power in the hands of church-offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers we are to ſpeak in the enſuing chapter.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="14" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>That the power of the keyes and of binding and looſing are not committed to all church-officers, but to the ministers of the Goſpell only.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN the third place, we are to take notice that the Rever. Aſſembly doth not declare, nor Mr. Gilleſpie, what they mean by church-offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; whether the diſpencers of the word and Sacraments only, or with them the lay-elders &amp; deacons: for they inveſt them promiſcuouſly with the power of the keyes, of binding and looſing, and of remitting and retaining ſins, againſt the opinion of Amyraldus, Walaeus, Apollonius, and moſt of the presbyterians, who attribute the power of the keyes only to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ordained; as indeed it doth not belong to any others to preach, and to adminiſter the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. Therefore one would have expected the aſſembly ſhould make ſome diſtinction both of officers and power. It may be by the word <hi>reſpectively</hi> they meant, that a part of the power of the keyes and of binding and looſing
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:123664:103"/> doth belong to lay-elders, as far as concerneth governing and cenſuring; but to the miniſters belongeth not only the ſame portion of power common to lay-elders, but, over and above, the power of preaching, adminiſtring the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, voting in ſynods, and determining au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatively of controverſies of faith.</p>
               <p>But how can they make good by the Scripture, that lay-elders are inveſted with the power of the keyes, and of binding and looſing, ſince this power was bequeathed only to Peter, and with him to all the miniſters of the Goſpell, as am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors from Chriſt, to whom God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the word of reconciliation, 2 Cor. 5. v. 19, 20? Is there any mention in the Scripture of church-officers that have a power of the keyes, and of binding and looſing, and yet have not the word of reconciliation committed to them?</p>
               <p>I cannot deny but that God ſometimes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth uſe of private men to bind and to looſe in ſeverall acts of theirs; as when they convert o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which otherwiſe is the work of the publick miniſtery, and when a brother forgiveth hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily a brother, and beſeecheth God to forgive him, or a wronged party complaineth to God in ſecret of a notable injurie received openly, for which he cannot have ſatisfaction by men. And of this kind of binding and looſing by private men may be underſtood the words Matth. 18. v. 18. as Theophylactus, Eraſtus and Gualterus expound them. But this private men do not by
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:123664:103"/> any duty inherent in their outward calling and office, but by a diſpenſation of God, whoſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit bloweth where it liſteth, employing the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of a weak ſimple woman or artificer, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to confound or convert the great and wiſe ones of the world; ſometimes binding and looſing without any intervention of private mens prayers and complaints, but only at the ſight of ſome great oppreſſion ſuſtained, even when the party oppreſſed is taken away, or of blood ſhed, which as it doth cry to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſo may it be ſaid to bind in heaven.</p>
               <p>Therefore miniſters being by vertue of their office and calling to bind and to looſe, I do not underſtand how any other perſons, as lay-elders and members of presbyteries and ſynods, ſhould have an ordinary power to bind and to looſe, and have the keyes of heaven committed to them, and yet not be entruſted with the word of reconciliation, and with the preaching of the Goſpell. Hath the Lord Jeſus Chriſt given a commiſſion by halves, ſo as that ſome church-officers ſhall have a power of binding and looſing (for the Rever. Aſſembly aſcribeth to all church-officers indifferently that power) who are not to have the power of preaching and of adminiſtring the ſacraments?</p>
               <p>I further acknowledge, that the church hath had from the time of the Apoſtles helps of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, of which Ambroſe ſpeaketh, and ſuch as the Jewiſh ſynagogues had; but that they
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:123664:104"/> had one part of the power of the keyes (which they will have to be the government) &amp; had not the other part (which is of preaching the Goſpell and converting men to Chriſt) I read no where, neither in Scripture nor in antiquity: for as the power of the keyes cannot be ſevered from the power of binding and looſing, ſo neither of theſe two qualifications will admit a diviſion; as that lay-elders ſhould have but a ſhare in the handling of the keyes, and miniſters ſhould have them entirely.</p>
               <p>Whoſoever readeth the outlandiſh divines, all presbyterians, will find, that they aſcribe no power of the keyes to other church-officers then miniſters of the Goſpell; that what power other officers, as lay-elders, have, is meerly by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the paſtors, and, as Mareſius ſaith, by communication. Loco 15. §. 75. theſe be his words: <hi>ſic reſidet penes ſenatum eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum omnis juriſdictio eccleſiastica, ut illa proprie ſit radicaliter in paſtoribus, in ſeniori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus vero qui illis aſſident communicative.</hi> So Capellus, <hi>the ſium parte priore,</hi> dividing the church-officers, <hi>theſ.</hi> 32. gives the whole power of the keyes and of excommunicating to the paſtors, not the rectors. <hi>Paſtores habent po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtatem docendi, arguendi &amp; increpandi, &amp;, ſi opus ſit, à ſacris arcendi atque ſubmovendi, quod excommunicare dicitur.</hi> So that they do but claw the other church-officers with the key of diſcipline, which, as Mareſius ſpeaketh, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:123664:104"/> in the paſtors: and to that purpoſe ſpeaketh a great Divine, whom I alledge <hi>Parae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſ. p.</hi> 600. <hi>when lay-men ſit in councills, and there deliver their opinions as judges, about articles of faith and the uſe of the keyes, this is done more by the conceſſion of paſtors, then by any right or ancient cuſtome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here by the way it is obſervable, that as the power of binding and looſing and the power of the keyes are convertible and equivalent terms in a propoſition, ſo one of them is not more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible then the other. Now ſure it is, there can be no ſuch thing as a leſſe meaſure of power of the keyes committed to lay-elders, and a greater to miniſters: for this power of the keyes being a power of introducing men into the church, either viſible or inviſible, ſpecially that power by which God opens the hearts of men by the preaching of the Goſpell; it cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that it ought to be or is performed by halves, as that the lay-elders ſhould have one half of that power committed to them, and that Jeſus Chriſt had given them the keyes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but not the main operation of the keyes; as if one ſhould give the keeping of his keyes to his ſteward, but not the power to open the doors with them. Since then it is not likely that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath committed the keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven by halves, the like alſo muſt be thought of the power of binding &amp; looſing, which are by all divines taken for one and the ſame.</p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:123664:105"/>
               <p>It is the opinion both of the rever. diſſenting brethren, and of the Rever. Aſſembly, (in a book called reaſons of the diſſenting, &amp;c. p. 6. and 58.) that both keyes are given together, and not one without the other; though, as the Rever. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly ſaith, one may be abler to exerciſe one then the other: which ſheweth that no church-officer can (albeit abler to rule then to preach) be endowed with a power of ruling without the power of preaching. But the Rever. Aſſembly ſaith, <hi>both keyes are given together, but neither to be exerciſed without a call, and ſometimes one may be called to exerciſe the one and not the other.</hi> It is not poſſible for me to apprehend what weight this hath: for ſince they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that no church-officer doth receive one key without the other, it is not poſſible he can be called to the handling of one key only, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they will ſay he is called to keep the other key idle, hung by his ſide.</p>
               <p>It being thus made evident, that the power of the keyes and of binding and looſing are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſolely to the miniſters of the Goſpell, who are entruſted with the word of reconciliation; it is likewiſe of neceſſary conſequence, if there be any ſuch thing as a power of excommunication and inflicting church-cenſures, as a conſequent of binding and looſing, that this ſaid power ſhould appertain to the miniſters of the Goſpell only, and that neither lay-elders, deacons nor members of churches, be enabled to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:123664:105"/> by any warrant of binding and looſing from Chriſt.</p>
               <p>None of theſe things being, as I hope, denia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the power of excommunication being thus reſtrained to the miniſters of the Goſpell alone; if it be made good that excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is no law of Chriſt, it will follow neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, either that excommunication is not an act of the power of the keyes, and of binding and looſing, committed to the miniſters of the Goſpell, or that their power is none of the power of the keyes, but exorbitant, tranſcending the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits ſet by Chriſt, and bringing forth acts which are none of Chriſts.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That God hath not given to the church-officers of the Goſpell a certain platform of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and that it is arbitrary and of humane institution, and therefore not to be adminiſtred by a power diſtinct from the humane.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe fourth and the laſt thing to enquire into in this 30. chapter of the Confeſſion of the Rever. Aſſembly is, the rule and modell that church-officers are to govern by: which were it granted to be expreſſely ſet down in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, would be no ſtronger an argument for a
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:123664:106"/> government placed in church-officers diſtinct from the magiſtrate under the new Teſtament, then it was under the old, when there was a very exact form of church-government, and yet no way diſtinct from that of the magiſtrate. Which makes me much wonder, that in that church, loaden with ſuch an infinite multitude of rites, ceremonies, conſtitutions, lawes, whereof the Chriſtian church is wholly freed, there was no diſtinction of government and juriſdiction from that of the magiſtrate; and yet that there ſhould be ſuch a diſtinction of juriſdiction in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian church, which hath no modell nor ſcheme of diſcipline, as the Jewiſh church had, but ſuch as in prudence is aſſumed by the joint conſent of paſtor and people. That there was no plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of government given to church-officers by Jeſus Chriſt or the Apoſtles, may be proved by a cloud of witneſſes: I will content my ſelf with a few. Camero in his book of the church p. 369. ſaith, <hi>that the Chriſtian church hath no need of certain lawes, ſeeing it is made up of men of ripe years, not of children under peda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogy:</hi> and a little lower, <hi>non eſt eccleſia certis circumſtantiis alligata, the church is not tyed to certain circumſtances.</hi> The like ſaith his ſcholar and great admirer Amyraldus, namely in his <hi>Synopſis Salmurienſis</hi> cap. 30. of the ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall power §. 4, 5, &amp; 6. So ſpeaketh Capellus in his <hi>Theſ. Theol. parte priore de po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testate &amp; regimine eccleſiae</hi> theſ. 40. where
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:123664:106"/> we have theſe words: <hi>in tantum valet eccleſia conſtitutio &amp; definitio, quantum eſt ratione ſubnixa; The conſtitution and definition of the church is ſo far valid, as it is grounded upon reaſon:</hi> therefore not upon the Scripture. Much more large and as expreſſe he is in the third part of <hi>Theſ. Salmurienſes, de vario ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae regimine,</hi> theſ. 16. and 17. So is Meſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zat no leſſe expreſſe in his book of the church, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. <hi>God hath defined nothing in the externall order and polity about the worſhip of God, but only hath preſcribed that all things ſhould be done decently and orderly.</hi> But were there any platform of government, judicious and learned Mr. <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> the moſt able and unpartiall judge in this matter, will tell us (Harmon. on the 1 Cor. 5.) that it was accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that of the Jewiſh ſynagogues, which yet was aſſumed by a voluntary and prudentiall choice, not upon any ſpeciall command from Chriſt or his Apoſtles. Which notion of his, which was alſo mine before we could or had conferred one anothers notes, doth lead us into many conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It doth decide the argument of the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent chapter, proving that the power of the keyes and of binding and looſing is committed not to all church-officers indifferently, but to the miniſters of the Goſpell only. For if it be reaſonable, as the Rever. Aſſembly ſaith in their humble advice to the Parliament, and as we
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:123664:107"/> have examined before, that the Chriſtian church ſhould have their elders as well as that of the Iews, it is alike reaſonable, as Mr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> ſaith, that the nature and extent of both juriſdictions and powers ſhould be the ſame; and that, if the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders among the Jewes did not act in ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues as men inveſted with the power of the keyes, and of binding and looſing, but with the power of magiſtracy, the like ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the elders of the new Teſtament. That the elders of the church of the Jewes had power of magiſtracy, it is evident by their acts, as fining, impriſoning, caſting out, whipping, and the like; and in that the elders of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament are moſt unlike thoſe of the old: and therefore the Jewiſh elders could be no preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Chriſtian elders: not <hi>de facto,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe never exerciſe that power; nor <hi>de jure,</hi> for the Rever. Aſſembly will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the elders of the old Teſtament had a right to thoſe acts of magiſtracy which they performed in their ſynagogues, but will deny that now the Chriſtian elders have ſuch a right: although for my part I know no inconvenience to aſſert that the elders in both times had alike right to all mentioned acts of magiſtracy, though for ſome reaſons it is not found ſo expedient un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpell by the presbyterian churches.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We may well conceive, that if the act of putting out of the church was an act of magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy under the old Teſtament, there is no reaſon it ſhould be now otherwiſe.</p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:123664:107"/>
               <p n="3">3. That likewiſe if the church of the Jewes never knew nor exerciſed in their ſynagogues a juriſdiction diſtinct from that of the magiſtrate, neither now are the Chriſtian ſynagogues or churches to know, or exerciſe ſuch a diſtinct power.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But ſtrange it is that, ſince God giving ſuch very exact lawes as he did to the church of the Jewes, yet he gave not to that church a juriſdiction diſtinct from that of the magiſtrate, it ſhould now be quite otherwiſe; and that God that gave no expreſſe lawes, diſcipline or rule for the government of the Chriſtian church, yet ſhould inveſt them with a power diſtinct from that of the magiſtrate.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It ſeems altogether incongruous that that power and juriſdiction, as is the eccleſiaſticall, which mainly is converſant about lawes, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions and rules which are inſtituted and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by men, and do not oblige either actively or paſſively, but as they are commanded by men, I ſay, it is altogether unreaſonable, that ſuch a juriſdiction ſhould not be placed in the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate; he being the fountain and ſpring from whom all humane juriſdictions, lawes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions do flow. And it is ſo much the more abſurd and unreaſonable that conſtitutions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, canons, diſcipline, meerly of humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, ſhould be ordered and commanded by a power and juriſdiction meerly Divine, and diſtinct from that of the magiſtrate; when as
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:123664:108"/> all conſtitutions, lawes and ordinances given to the Jewes, and all being of Divine inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were notwithſtanding ordered and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the magiſtrate, &amp; not by the keepers of an eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction diſtinct from the civil.</p>

               </argument>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:123664:108"/>
               <p>HAving examined what plea the Rever. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly can have in the 30. chapter of their confeſſion for a government diſtinct from that of the magiſtrate, the 31. chapter, which is of ſynods and councells, is more ſuperficially to be handled: for what we have ſaid before of the juriſdiction of churches, plainly ſheweth that the juriſdiction of ſynods is no otherwiſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from that of the magiſtrate; for ſince ſynods muſt be made up of church-officers, it is not poſſible they ſhould impart to ſynods what they have not in churches, and that thoſe that have not a juriſdiction in churches diſtinct from that of the magiſtrate, ſhould delegate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a power which they never had.</p>
               <p>I admit willingly the neceſſity of ſynods, as the firſt ſection doth: ſynods being neceſſary whether magiſtrates be orthodox or not, 1. for preſerving and reſtoring truth, 2. for uniting churches in one judgement, 3. for keeping an externall communion of Saints. And it were to be wiſhed, as the magiſtrate of England hath ſet up again the Lords houſe, ſo they would re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a houſe of convocation, or an aſſembly of miniſters meeting at the ſame time that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſits, treating ſuch queſtions in matters of religion as ſhould be propounded to them by the Parliament, or they themſelves ſhould peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Parliament to be handled; not being inveſted with more judiciall power then a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:123664:109"/> of merchants or ſea-men, called by the Parliament to give their advice about trade and navigation; in which convocation the major part of votes ſhould not be ſo much regarded by the Parliament, as the weight of their opinions and reaſons: and therefore, as it was in the laſt aſſembly, where 20. did not prevail againſt one diſſenting brother; ſo this convocation ſhould return to the Parliament, not the reſult of the whole aſſembly, becauſe carried by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part of the members, but the names of parties aſſenting and diſſenting.</p>
               <p>This convocation I humbly conceive ought to be made up only of miniſters of the Goſpell, that have wholly ſet apart themſelves for the work of the miniſtery and ſtudy of Divinity. For as the ſupreme magiſtrate uſually calls men of that calling and profeſſion about which he is to make lawes, as being the moſt fit to give coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell in the thing they are called for; ſo doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe none are ſo fit to be adviſed with in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters concerning religion, as thoſe that are moſt learned and verſed in it: for I hold them not only the fitter members in an aſſembly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened to treat of matters concerning religion, but alſo not unfit, yea as fit as any other men, to ſit and vote in Parliaments. For this opinion of a double juriſdiction, eccleſiaſticall and civil, that lay-men muſt be judges in civil courts, and miniſters in eccleſiaſticall aſſemblies, as it hath barred lay-men from ſitting, at leaſt from voting
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:123664:109"/> in ſynods and councels, ſo hath it removed clergy-men from ſitting and being judges in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil courts and Parliaments: which opinion hath out-gone the Papiſts in ſome things; for though they do not permit lay-men to have votes, yea hardly to ſit in ſynods, yet do the popiſh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates admit eccleſiaſticall men in their courts and judicatories: thus lately Biſhops in England ſate in Parliament. I confeſſe that Popes, to advance the building of their empire within the empires of magiſtrates, Kings and Emperours, would be ſure to have an oare in every boat, yea more, for though they have members of their own in civil courts, yet they permit no members of civil courts to ſit and vote in ſynods and councels. But ſome Proteſtant magiſtrates in reforming popery, as they have not ſo much relinquiſht and parted with their own right as popiſh magiſtrates, to looſe their right in calling and voting in ſynods, ſo have they more wronged the clergy, debarring them from ſitting and voting in their courts; which I humbly conceive to be a loſſe to the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and a wrong and injury done to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters: and thereupon I propound theſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Debarting of the miniſters from ſitting and voting in Parliament hath occaſioned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed mens minds, ſpecially of miniſters, in that opinion, that there is ſuch a thing in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and reaſon as a government in the hands
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:123664:110"/> of church-officers diſtinct from that of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, and that there is a double juriſdiction, &amp; two judicatories, one civil, whereof the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and laity are members and judges, and another eccleſiaſticall, in which miniſters only muſt ſit and vote: for miniſters think it but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that ſince they are kept off by the laity from being members in Parliament and in all civil judicatories, ſo likewiſe the magiſtrate and the laity ſhould not be admitted to ſit and vote in ſynods: whereas it being certain, that there is no ground in Scripture or reaſon for a double juriſdiction, &amp; a government diſtinct from that of the magiſtrate, and all judiciall proceedings in whatſoever court, aſſembly, Parliament, ſynods, presbyteries, being acts of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates juriſdiction, the miniſter now conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as as member of a Chriſtian common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, ought to enjoy the ſame priviledge as the other members of it. All which make me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that it was more heat then reaſon that made ſo many write againſt the Biſhops voting in Parliament; beſides it was no good work to divide juriſdictions, which by the miniſters ſitting and voting in Parliament, like other ranks of men, were re-united.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There being in a Parliament men of all ſorts and ranks, gentlemen, lawyers, phyſitians, apothecaries, merchants, and they all having an equall intereſt to maintain religion, lands, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, lawes, wife and children of their own; it
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:123664:110"/> is altogether unreaſonable, that miniſters, that are alike concerned in all theſe, and are as well members of the Commonwealth as the beſt of them, ſhould notwithſtanding as it were be cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out from having that priviledge that others of their fellow-citizens enjoy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is known that men do not ſit and vote in Parliament as merchants, phyſitians, ſilk-men or drapers, and that if there be new lawes to make, or old to alter, ſuppoſe about ſome manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, as cloth-working, a member of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being profeſſour of that craft which is in agitation, is the moſt able to diſcourſe upon that ſubject, and to ſtate how the thing may be regulated; and this he doth as a profeſſour of the craft about which the law is to be made: but when the thing debated is to be carried by vote, &amp; receive the ſtamp of law, &amp; of publick autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, then, I ſay, none of the members give their votes as profeſſours of the art and ſcience which they exerciſe in the Commonwealth, and which is debated in Parliament, no not if a member were a chief juſtice of England; but all ſit and vote as men inveſted with power of legiſlation, and at that time a phyſitian voteth not in the quality and capacity of a phyſitian, no not when lawes are made for phyſitians and apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries, although when they are in debate, a phyſitian may diſcourſe pertinently of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, as a phyſitian and skilfull in his art. This is the very caſe of miniſters of the Goſpell, who
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:123664:111"/> for that reaſon, that men do not ſit and vote in Parliament conſidered as men of ſuch a calling or profeſſion in the Commonwealth, ought likewiſe to vote &amp; ſit in Parliament: for as the profeſſion of phyſick or manufacture doth not deveſt a man from being a good and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Commonwealths-man, ſo neither doth the paſtorall calling.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It ſeems to me very unreaſonable, yea un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcionable, that any mans profeſſion or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, how high or low ſoever, ſhould lay an inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity upon the perſon of one, though never ſo much capable and ſufficient, to contribute his wit and counſell towards the common-weal; as if the magiſtrate would not take a loan of money of 100000 l. of one that had a long cloak, but would be willing to take it of one that had a ſhort cloak; or a man in danger of drowning would not take his neighbour by the cloak or by his hair, for fear of ſpoiling or diſordering of them: for thus do thoſe which will not admit the advice of a miniſter in publick deliberations, were he never ſo able to ſerve the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth by his wit, wiſedome and induſtrie, and the need never ſo great, meerly becauſe of his habit, and his profeſſion of the miniſtery. Which calling I am ſo far from thinking that it doth diſinable him from ſitting and voting in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that not only it renders him the fitter, but alſo that he is not thereby hindred from attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting any noble action which might turn to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:123664:111"/> ſome great publick benefit. A miniſter having the valour of Caeſar, &amp; ability to ſubdue Rome, or a ſecret to burn all the ſhips of the King of Spain in his ports, I conceive that his miniſtery ought not to keep him off from being employed to uſe all his induſtry to ſerve the Church of God or his countrey in ſuch a way. But why is not a phyſitian diſinabled by his profeſſion to ſit in Parliament, and a Divine is? whenas there is a great deal more affinity betwixt the profeſſion of a Divine and the debates in Parliament, then betwixt them and the profeſſion of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Although men do not uſually fit and vote in Parliament by the right of the calling and profeſſion they are of in the Commonwealth, except they ſit by their birth; yet it were to be wiſht that men that are generally more skilled in moſt profeſſions, and beſt able to judge what is right or wrong, and are not ignorant of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the world, ſhould be called: ſuch as I conceive are univerſity-men, and miniſters of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Since the greateſt end of magiſtracy is to advance the Kingdom of the Lord Jeſus, and that for obtaining of that end it is needfull to make lawes and conſtitutions ſubſervient to it, why ſhould miniſters of all men be left out, whoſe education and profeſſion renders them more capable to adviſe for the obtaining of that great end?</p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:123664:112"/>
               <p n="7">7. Since alſo there is ſuch a complication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the church &amp; ſtate, as they cannot ſo much as be imagined aſunder, and that moſt lawes and conſtitutions made by men are grounded upon (and have ſome warrant from) Divine writ, and that thoſe that appoint by law oaths to be taken, ſhould at leaſt be well adviſed about the nature of the oath; I do conceive, that ſince all ranks are promiſcuouſly called to adviſe about theſe, of all men miniſters, beſt furniſhed and ſtored with knowledge, and acquainted with the right and plea of conſcience, upon which equity, right and law is grounded, ſhould not be forgot. Why ſhould not men, who make it their whole employment to ſtudy the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, be as fit judges in Parliaments and high courts of judicature, as Phyſitians or merchants.</p>
               <p n="8">8. There is the ſame reaſon for miniſters to ſit in Parliament, as there was for prieſts and Levites to ſit in ſynagogues and judiciall aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of the Jewes, and in all conſultations of ſtate; it being certain that the great Sanedrim was a mixture of Prieſts and Levites with the Princes and heads of the people.</p>
               <p n="9">9. There is equall reaſon, that if the ſupreme magiſtrate calls ſay-men to ſit and vote in ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, he ſhould call the clergy to ſit and vote in Parliament.</p>
               <p n="10">10. There was no ſuch thing ſo much as heard for many hundred years after the fourth age, that
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:123664:112"/> miniſters and Biſhops ſhould be thought inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to ſit and vote in the ſupreme courts of the nation. I could prove it by the practiſe of Italy, Germanie, France, Spain and England, for above 7 or 8 hundred years, even far within popery; that though the Pope had much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced the hatching of his two egges, eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call &amp; civil juriſdiction, yet all ſtate-aſſemblies were not diſtinguiſht either from ſynods, or from civil courts, but promiſcuouſly men of all ranks and profeſſions, Senators, Biſhops, Lords, Prieſts, Gentlemen, did ſit and vote in one aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly and place, about any matter whatſoever, rite, law, diſcipline or ceremony. Neither is it to be conceived, that the cauſes debated in theſe aſſemblies were divided into two claſſes, and that when eccleſiaſticall matters were handled, clergy-men did then vote, and lay-men ſate mute; and when civil were in agitation, then the clergy were ſilent, and lay-men did only appear as judges: which is indeed a pretty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, but will not ſerve for a double juriſdiction. He that will ſee that further proved at large, needs but only read Blondellus <hi>de jure plebis:</hi> &amp;c. and Mr. Prinne in his book of <hi>Truth trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing over falſhood.</hi>
               </p>

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:123664:113"/> with ſecular matters; and therefore in courts of law or chancery, clergy-men diſpatched more buſineſſes then the laity, handled all caſes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept (it may be) criminall matters and wills, not being permitted to be executors of Teſtaments; otherwiſe they filled the courts ſo far, that there were no knowing men, yea none that could read or write but they: hence to this day no court, Juſtice of peace or lawyer, but hath his clerk, and they ſay ſtill, <hi>legit ut clericus,</hi> he reads like a clerk. This I find much urged by a famous lawyer, a Romaniſt, John du Tillet, in his memoires, who ſpeaking of the encroachments of the Popes of Rome, ſaith that they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes endeavoured to ſever what from the times of the Apoſtles was united, and to make of one juriſdiction two; which yet they could not ſo diſtinctly ſeparate, but that ſtill to our dayes one may ſee it was not ſo in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: <hi>and this old form,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hath remained to the having, even in our dayes, a medley of clergy and laity in our courts of Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I foreſee that ſome of the presbyterian bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren will take me at advantage, for ſaying that miniſters may vote in ſynods, and there being inveſted with judiciall authority, make canons, lawes and conſtitutions, which bind churches to obedience: for if they may have that judiciall power in Parliaments, which doth oblige all men and ſocieties, and ſo churches, to obedience; why may not they have the ſame right &amp; power in ſynods?</p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:123664:113"/>
               <p>I hope the rever. brethren will not ſo require me for my pains in being their advocate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torting my plea made in their behalf againſt my ſelf. But I willingly grant, that the miniſters of the Goſpell have alike power of ſitting and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in ſynods, and in ſupreme courts of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate: but how? <hi>viz.</hi> if they be called to it by the magiſtrate; and ſo their acts, whether they ſit in ſynods or Parliaments, are a produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the magiſtrates juriſdiction delegated to them; and as ſuch they oblige all men, ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and churches. Beſides, as I ſaid, miniſters ſitting in Parliaments and ſynods do diſcourſe and debate matters touching doctrine &amp; church-diſcipline, as miniſters of the Goſpell; but they reduce what they diſcourſed of into lawes, and ſtamp their authority and ſanction upon it, as men inveſted with judiciall authority from the magiſtrate: juſt as I ſaid of phyſitians, who vote in Parliaments not as ſuch, but as judges of the land.</p>
               <p>Againſt the miniſters ſitting and voting in Parliament it may be objected, that thereby they would be kept off from the main care they are to attend, which is over ſouls, and from the preaching of the Goſpell. I anſwer 1. that their particular calling, which is to be miniſters of the Goſpell, ought not to keep them off from a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate taking care and looking over things that are of leſſe concernment, as that of familie, land, eſtate, ſuits in law, much leſſe to mind
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:123664:114"/> the generall good of the nation, in which reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and peace are mainly concerned. 2. There being two branches of the power of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, one of legiſlation, the other of juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; this latter power is exerciſed by judges, Mayors, Sheriffs, Sergeants and the like: This power as men that have otherwiſe a conſtant profeſſion which taketh them wholly up, as phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, ſouldiers, marine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

For the making of a law is like the making of a coach, which being made in few dayes, will be many years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driving by the coach-man, before there be need of a new one: ſo in a well-conſtituted ſtate, a good law, which requireth but a little time to make it, will continue many hundred years. A miniſter may be well diſpenſed with for a little intermiſſion of his ordinary calling, to contribute his counſell to the making a law, which may be of very good uſe a long time; though there be no need he ſhould buſie himſelf further, like a coach-driver, to ſee by a power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </gap> juriſdiction, the law to take right courſe, and be well obeyed. I believe if in the firſt Parliament of Queen E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth, that drove away popery and ſettled the Proteſtant religion, many of the godly miniſters that ſuffered perſecution in Queen Maries days
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:123664:114"/> had been ſitting and voting in Parliament, the then-reformation would have been much more compleat. 3. Some miniſters may be found, whoſe parts lye leſſe for preaching, and more for government, and who have wiſe politick heads: why may not ſuch be fit members in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament? 4. As there is no reaſon to deprive a man of his right, becauſe he cannot alwayes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to make uſe of it: ſo muſt not a miniſter be deveſted of his right to ſit in Parliament, becauſe it may be he cannot alwayes attend it. A phyſitian would be loth, becauſe of his great pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, to be made incapable to ſit in Parliament; ſo would a Divine, however much taken up with the work of his miniſtery.</p>
               <p>The premiſſes conſidered, I conceive that the Rever. Aſſembly doth part with its own right, when they ſay in the laſt ſection of the third chapter, <hi>that ſynods and councells are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude nothing but what is eccleſiaſticall, and are not to intermeddle with civil affairs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe by way of humble petition in caſes extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, or by way of advice, for ſatisfaction of conſciences, if they be thereunto required by the civil magiſtrate.</hi> By which as they ſeem to keep off magiſtrates and lay-men from ſitting and voting in ſynods, ſo they bar themſelves from ſitting and voting in Parliament.</p>
               <p>But if ſuch aſſemblies as were the great Sane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim, the ſynagogues of the Jewes, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions that I have mentioned for 7. or 8. hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:123664:115"/> years in Chriſtian ſtates, the politick eccleſiaſticall Senates among the Helvetians, and that which was ſettled in the firſt reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Prince Palatine of the Rhene; if, I ſay, ſuch aſſemblies, in which there is a mixture of men and cauſes, are lawfull, as indeed it were very fit there ſhould be no aſſemblies of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blick concernment but of this nature; why may not in theſe aſſemblies lay-men conclude in ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall matters, and miniſters in civil? If they may not, or it muſt be with diſtinction and caution, how ſhall the conſcience of a man ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in thoſe aſſemblies, if he be a lay-man, be reſolved, when he may intermeddle while eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall matters are debated; and likewiſe if civil things be in agitation, how far a miniſter ſitting in the ſame company may interpoſe &amp; vote? muſt, when civil affairs are handled, the eccleſiaſticall perſons firſt be required to vote, or muſt they petition to have that liberty? It may be they mean, that when the aſſemblie is upon eccleſiaſticall affairs, that then the laity ſhould likewiſe petition the clergy for a liberty of voting and intermeddling.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe a member of this aſſembly be both a States-man and an elder of a church, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an eccleſiaſticall man, muſt he change his name and perſonage as the nature of the matter handled requireth, profeſſing not to interpoſe in ſuch a buſineſſe in the capacity of a church-officer, but as a member of the Commonwealth?</p>
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:123664:115"/>
               <p>And how ſhall the conſcience of a man be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved what is an eccleſiaſticall affair, what a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, that he may not doubt when he may vote and intermeddle, when he muſt ſit mute and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, or go out of the aſſembly? For the caſuiſts have not yet determined what is eccleſiaſticall, what civil: for ſome of them make the diſcipline of the church of humane conſtitution, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be ordered, directed and commanded by the ſame power that giveth ſanction to all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane lawes. And if it be put to the queſtion, when, how often, in what place ſynods are to be convened, what time they muſt ſit, &amp; what matter they muſt handle, may not the lay-man then interpoſe as in a buſineſſe of his claſſis? may not alſo eccleſiaſticall perſons do the like? Beſides, 100. conſtitutions may be found of ſuch a mixt nature, that it is not yet reſolved what claſſis they pertain unto, whether eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall or civil: ſuch are the lawes about wills, marriages, tithes, tenths, uſury, collections for the poor, appointing of dayes for faſting or thankſgiving, lawes for pious uſes, and the like.</p>
               <p>Will this expedient ſerve to reſolve the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, <hi>viz.</hi> if ſuch an aſſembly of mixt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and cauſes be named neither a councell or ſynod, nor a civil judicatory, but an aſſembly, or ſome other name participating of the nature of both? as if names could alter the nature of the thing, and ſatisfy the conſcience.</p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:123664:116"/>
               <p>In ſhort, I believe the reverend aſſembly both wrong themſelves, and no way ſatisfy mens minds and conſciences, in not ſtating what is eccleſiaſticall, what is not, and how far this or that man may meddle in eccleſiaſticall and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil matters, what name is to be given to this or that aſſembly.</p>
               <p>I am crowded with matter that were worth deciding about ſynods; which argument I han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled largely in the 22. and 23. chapters of my <hi>Paraeneſis.</hi> The power of ſynods is deciſive, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective and declarative: they decide by way of diſcuſſion and diſputation; they direct by way of counſell; and they declare their opinions as expert and well known and read in the thing that is in queſtion. Coercive and judiciall power they have none, but what is delegated from the magiſtrate or from private churches: ſo that though the authority of a ſynod is greater then that of a private church, yet the power of that church is greater then that of a ſynod.</p>
               <p>If there be an union of churches, as there ought to be even under an orthodox magiſtrate, all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and decrees are no otherwiſe binding as laws, then as they have the ſtamp of magiſtracy upon them: <hi>Supremi magiſtratus approbatio est ſupremum arreſtum, ut loquuntur,</hi> ſaith Feſtus Hommius <hi>diſp.</hi> 18. <hi>theſ.</hi> 4; and <hi>diſp.</hi> 17. theſ. 3. <hi>the approbation of the magiſtrate is the ſupreme decree.</hi> And not only reformers, but alſo ſome Romaniſts, namely the authour of the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:123664:116"/> Review of the councill of Trent, a learned book, and which the learned Dr. Langbane thought his pains worthy in his youth to turn into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh. Lib. 3. cap. 13. <hi>the Emperour, as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known, the Monarch of churches, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident to the ſynodall ſentences, gives them force, compoſeth eccleſiaſticall orders, giveth law, life and policy to thoſe that ſerve at the altar.</hi> Is it credible, that a Romaniſt ſhould be of a more ſincere judgement in this matter then a reformed Chriſtian, ſuch as Mr. Gilleſpie?</p>
               <p>Thoſe that are for a judiciall power of ſynods over churches do alledge the ſynod of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; which being infallible, is no example to us, no more then the miracles of Chriſt and the Apoſtles argue that ordinary miniſters muſt work miracles. When private churches can be ſure that a ſynod in theſe dayes is led by ſuch a ſpirit of infallibility, they may yield to it without diſputing; yet not without examining, as did thoſe of Beroea, who tryed the Sermon of St. Paul, whether it was agreeable to other ſcriptures: and were there now a ſynod made up of 40. or 50. men like Peter and Paul, a church ſhould reverence their orders; but yet that ſynod ſhould have no coercive juriſdiction over the church, but ſuch as overcometh the inward man by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, and leadeth him as it were captive to the obedience of truth. And in caſe men and churches were not perſwaded, or did delay obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and ſubmiſſion, I ſay that ſuch an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicall
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:123664:117"/> ſynod could bring neither churches nor men to an outward conformity to their ſentences, lawes and decrees, without a power del<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Let us come to the ſecond ſection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As magistrates may lawfully call a ſynod of miniſters and other fit perſons, to conſult and adviſe with about matters of religion; ſo, if magiſtrates be open enemies to the church, the miniſters of Christ of themſelves, by vertue of their office, or they with other fit perſons, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on delegation from their churches, may meet together in ſuch aſſemblies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is nothing in this ſection but I will willingly grant. 1. They yield that magiſtrates may call ſynods; 2. that a ſynod is an aſſembly of men convocated by the magiſtrate; 3. who are to adviſe the magiſtrate about ordering mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion and diſcipline; 4. under an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox magiſtrate, as ſynods receive their juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction from the magiſtrate, ſo private churches under them ought to receive their orders and conſtitutions as lawes of the magiſtrate: but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an heterodox magiſtrate, ſynods receive their authority from private churches; ſo that canons and decrees of ſynods are ſo far valid, as they are approved or ratified by private churches, that have conferred the power, they being then in lieu of the magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>The generall aſſembly of Scotland, perceiving
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:123664:117"/> that this article doth much weaken eccleſiaſticall power under an orthodox magiſtrate, hath thought fit in their generall aſſembly at Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh Aug. 27. ſeſſ. 23. to put a gloſſe or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon it, ſaying <hi>that the aſſembly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth ſome part of the ſecond article of the thirty firſt chapter, only of Kirks not ſettled or conſtituted in point of government: and that although in ſuch Kirks a ſynod of miniſters and other fit perſons may be called by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates authority and nomination, without any other call, to conſult and adviſe with about matters of religion; and although likewiſe the miniſters of Chriſt, without delegation from their churches, may of themſelves and by vertue of their office meet together ſynodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally in ſuch Kirks not yet conſtituted; yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe ought to be done in Kirks conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and ſettled.</hi> So they will have the ſecond article to be underſtood of churches not conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted or ſettled: in which caſe, they ſay the magiſtrate may call ſynods; elſe they ſay it doth not belong to him, but to the miniſters, who then ought to aſſemble of themſelves, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any commiſſion from the magiſtrate: which is expreſſely againſt the literall meaning of the ſecond article, which, as all others of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, is of things that are to be received, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and practiſed at all times, and which they count of Divine right, and for which therefore they alledge places of Scripture, namely Iſa. 49.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:123664:118"/> v. 23. <hi>Kings ſhall be thy nurſing fathers;</hi> a place which, in my opinion, maketh little to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, no more then the place out of 1. Tim. 2. v. 2. where we are bidden to pray for Kings, doth to prove the power of magiſtrates in calling of ſynods. Neither doth that place, 2 Chronic. 19. v. 9. &amp;c. avail much, but only that magiſtrates may call and conſtitute aſſemblies in generall: for there is no ſpeech there of any eccleſiaſticall aſſemblies, for they were not yet thought on at that time. The 29. and 30. chapters of 2 Chronic. for the magiſtrates power of calling ſynods, is of the ſame ſtamp. It is true, chap. 29. v. 4. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiah gathered Prieſts &amp; Levites together, but it was to make an exho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tation to them; not that they ſhould congregate into a ſynod in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with judiciall authority: I think that none ever yet dream'd of it, that ſynods in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament could be proved out of that place. The laſt place Prov. 11. v. 14. ſpeaketh of counſellors, in the multitude of which there is ſafety; but not a word there of calling of them, nor that thoſe who were called were Prieſts and Levites, but rather any other. One would almoſt think that they had a mind to weaken a good cauſe, and make invalid the power of the magiſtrate, by alledging places that make nothing for it: but however they will have them to paſſe for valid proofs, that magiſtrates by divine right are to call ſynods. But to the matter: I am quite of another mind then our brethren the Scots are,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:123664:118"/> and I deſire to be judged by any other then by them, whether there be any ſpark of reaſon or truth in their ſaying. Is it not more like that in a well-conſtituted church things muſt run their wonted channel, &amp; that the power of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſynods belongeth to the magiſtrate; but the church being in a troubled condition, then that miniſters, yea any good man ſhould contribute his helping hand toward the reforming of the church, whether by way of ſynods or otherwiſe, without expecting orders from the magiſtrate? <hi>In turbata eccleſia omnis homo miles eſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianus &amp; miniſter.</hi> But who ſees not but the drift of our brothers the Scots is, to conſtitute a juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction independent from that of the magiſtrate?</p>
               <p>The third ſection or article of the 31. chapt: of the confeſſion needeth a comment, to make it agree with the ſecond: <hi>it belongeth to ſynods and councels miniſterially to determine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies of faith and caſes of conſcience, to ſet down rules and directions for better or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the publick worſhip of God and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his church, to receive complaints in caſes of mal-adminiſtration, and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatively to determine the ſame; which decrees and determinations, if conſonant to the word of God, are to be received with reverence and ſubmiſſion, not only for their agreement with the word, but alſo for the power whereby they are made, as being an ordinance of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed thereunto in his word.</hi> Firſt, they do
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:123664:119"/> not define what ſynods are here meant, whether convocated by the magiſtrate or by private churches, or even convocated by the miniſters themſelves. If by the magiſtrate, how can a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men called to adviſe him make conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions valid, except they be firſt ſubmitted to the judgement and approbation of him by whoſe authority they were aſſembled? The like judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may we make of the decrees of ſy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ods convocated by the common conſent of private churches. If the miniſters aſſemble of their own accord, were they ſo many Apoſtles, they muſt have ſome magiſtracy to give vigour of law obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to obedience, either actively or paſſively, elſe their canons would have no juriſdiction, but over them they could overcome by perſwaſion.</p>
               <p>The fourth article or ſection is; <hi>all ſynods or councels ſince the Apostles time, whether ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall or particular, may erre, and many have erred: therefore they are not to be made the rule of faith or practiſe, but to be uſed as an help in both.</hi> A ſynod is no rule but to him that is willing to make it a rule. All the ſynods power and authority is only ſo much as either the magiſtrates will is, or a conſcience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened or convinced is perſwaded to yield unto. I know no middle way to create authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. There is a rare ſaying of Feſtus Hommius diſp. 18. theſ. 2. de <hi>concil. authoritate: the foundation of all ſynodicall authority is an agreement with the divine truth and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:123664:119"/> whereof we must be firſt evidently and clearly made certain, before the ſynod get any authority with us.</hi> So that ſynods are of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, when men and churches are clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the equity, reaſonableneſſe and truth of their deciſions.</p>
               <p>I am not of the opinion of Gregory Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen and Bazil, who condemned all ſynods ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally; for I believe they are of very good uſe, and neceſſarily to be had, ſo that the members be not inveſted with any judiciall power inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent from the magiſtrate, or from particular churches, whoſe deciſions be counſells and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices given to them both, not lawes: otherwiſe I think little or no good is to be expected from them, and that they are not a way to decide con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Judges in an aſſembly never ſo upright muſt be indifferent to perſons and cauſes; but ſo can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not miniſters be in a ſynod: for a ſynod made up of orthodox Divines, is no competent judge of Arminians. Therefore it is no marvell if the councell of Trent did condemn the Lutherans in the firſt Seſſion, before they ever heard them; or that a late ſynod at Charenton, prepoſſeſſed againſt independent churches in England, did as it were anathematize them, though none of the members of that ſynod, being 80. in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, had hardly ſeen the face or writings of any of them. 2. It ſeemeth to be againſt all courſes and proceedings of courts, either of law or chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:123664:120"/> that both plaintiffs and defendants ſhould ſit as judges in one judicatory to determine their own cauſe. 3. If there be but one party, either the defendent or plaintiff, ſitting &amp; voting, no doubt but he will caſt his adverſary out of the court; therefore there being no other then Proteſtants ſitting and voting in the ſynod of Dordrecht, the Arminians could not chuſe but looſe their cauſe: beſides that it is no leſſe unreaſonable, that one party ſhould ſubmit to the judgement of his adverſe party. 4. It ſeemeth neither juſt nor reaſonable, that churches and men ſhould ſubmit to the major part of the members ſtating and concluding of any matter of religion, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to the weight of the reaſons of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor part diſſenting. Should in ſynods alwaies the major number of votes carry it; in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall councill, made up of Papiſts, Lutherans, Calviniſts, no doubt but that party that is moſt numerous, though it carrieth it but by one vote, would give religion and faith to all the reſt: therefore the late long Parliament did wiſely decline to adhere rather to the major part of the members in the aſſembly, who had voted for a presbyterian government, reſerving to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the liberty to weigh the reaſons of both, not to number the perſons. Hence we may gather, how unreaſonable it is in matters of faith and religion, that that which is not the act of all, ſhould be reputed as done by all; when as it may fall out, that the major
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:123664:120"/> part hath out-voted the minor but by one ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage: for uſually all collections, ſyntagmes of confeſſions of faith, canons and decrees, go cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and are publiſhed to the world, as if all the members had conſented to them, with a <hi>nemine contradicente.</hi> Thus the late confeſſion of faith and directory go for currant to be the opinion of the aſſembly, becauſe they were the act of the major part of them; albeit many godly and learned men among them had no hand in fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the 30. &amp; 31. chapters of the confeſſion. In affairs concerning temporall life it may be born with, when what hath been voted by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part of the counſell or Senat goeth for the act of all: and this was one of the ſtate-precepts that Philip the II. gave to Margerite Governeſs of the low-Countrves by the report of Strada. 5. In all great differences betwixt nation &amp; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, army and army party and party, the judges that are appointed to reconcile them muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound conditions by which parties in extremes ſhould come to ſome accommodation and moderation, each ſide if need be complying and parting with ſome of his right, to prevent a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of ſtrife. But ſuch a compoſition can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be expected in or by a ſynod, for making up differences in religion, ſince each ſide apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his opinion to be the truth, and would think it a great ſin to baulk any part of it, or admit an accommodation.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That the Iewiſh Church-officers had not a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction distinct from that of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. Mr. Gilleſpies distinction, that they were not materially but formally distinct, examined. The argument of Amyraldus, that though they had a diſtinct juriſdiction, yet the example of the church of the Iewes is no pattern to the Chriſtian church, diſcuſſed, and proved to be of no vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis ſubject, touching the identity or diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of juriſdiction eccleſiaſticall and civil among the Jewes, well underſtood, will decide the whole controverſie: which Mr. Gilleſpie well apprehendeth, and therefore perceiving the ſtrength of this plea, that good reaſon it is, that the eccleſiaſticall power ſhould be diſtinct or not diſtinct in the church of the Jewes as well as in that of the Chriſtians, ſince the power of the keyes and of binding and looſing, of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring, excommunicating, and making lawes authoritatively be the ſame in both churches; and therefore, that it cannot be ſuppoſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great inconvenience that the juriſdictions were indiſtinct amongſt the Jewes, but diſtinct amongſt the Chriſtians; this, I ſay, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:123664:121"/> by him, makes him withall endeavour to lay hold on that opinion that maketh juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions diſtinct in the Commonwealth of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael; for this ſuppoſition he takes to be the ground-work of the eccleſiaſticall juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>But I will not enter far into this matter, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the examen of the 30. chapter of the confeſſion of the Rever. Aſſembly taken off the main objection, from Amariah and Zebadiah; for I cannot think but Mr. Gilleſpie hath em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced this opinion for conveniency, and more becauſe it is ſubſervient to the fabrick of his book, then that it hath any great probability: 1. becauſe moſt of the learned Papiſts and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, even his fellow-presbyters, are of another judgement, who if they had had never ſo little ſhew or likelineſſe for a double juriſdiction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jewes, ſpecially the Papiſts, and with them Amyraldus and others, no doubt they would have made as much of this advantage to further their cauſe, as Mr. Gilleſpie thinketh to prevail with it for himſelf: 2. becauſe Mr. Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſpie, when he hath done what he can to aſſert a double juriſdiction in the church of the Jewes, reaps very little benefit by it; for he pulls down by his large conceſſions with one hand, what he hath ſtriven to ſet up with the other.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, it were an endleſſe labour to produce the names of the authors that are for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſtus opinion in this particular; and for one
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:123664:122"/> Conſtantinus l'Empereur which he pretends to be on his ſide, twenty may be brought of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion. Not long ſince diſcourſing with Manaſſeh Ben Iſrael, at the houſe of my noble friend Mr. Sadler, about this ſame ſubject, he told me he could not conceive how this opinion, that there was a double juriſdiction among the Jewes, was taken up by the Chriſtians, and that he held it altogether abſurd, againſt Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and reaſon. Nothing can be added to what Grotius, Selden and Cunaeus have written on this ſubject. Amyraldus in his Theſes <hi>de ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritu ſervitutis</hi> theſ. 28. ſaith, that religion and policy were ſo ſtraightly conjoyned among the Jewes, that one being overthrown, the other could not ſtand, but muſt needs fall too: and in his book of the government of the church p. 46. he ſaith, the ſame man did judge Iſrael as a ſoveraign magiſtrate, and was alſo over mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion. Lud. Capellus parte 3. <hi>de mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterii verbi neceſſitate</hi> theſ. 18, 19, &amp;c. doth not only conſpire with Amyraldus, but outgo him, in aſſerting that the 70. judges or elders, though lay-men, and not of the tribe of Levi, were not only to compoſe controverſies and ſuits in law, but alſo to inſtruct the people about the worſhip of God, and to teach them the fear of the Lord; ſo far that from the time of Ezra to Jeſus Chriſt any in the ſynagogues, which were known to be gifted, might teach, read and expound the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: which he proves by the example of Jeſus
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:123664:122"/> Chriſt Luc. 4. 17. who, though unknown, was admitted to expound the Scripture; and of St. Paul, Act. 13. 15. My rever. Father is of the ſame mind, namely in the 19. chapter <hi>de Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchia temporali,</hi> where he ſaith, that neither the Levites nor the chief Prieſts made uſe of any other law then that which was common, and that they had no eccleſiaſticall judges diſtinct from the civil. Iudicious <hi>R. Hooker</hi> is very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe for us in his 8. book of eccleſiaſticall poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty p. 144. <hi>Our ſtate is according to the pattern of Gods own ancient elect people; which people was not part of them the Commonwealth, and part of them the Church of God, but the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame people whole and entire were both under one chief governour, on whoſe ſupream autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they did all depend.</hi> I have alledged elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where Mr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> wholly concurring with Richard Hooker.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Herbert Thorndike,</hi> a judicious writer and much verſed in the antiquities of the Jewes, is wholly for an identity of juriſdiction among the Jewes. In 8. chapter he ſaith, <hi>that when Moſes was dead, a Preſident was choſen over and beſide the ſeventy, whom they called the Naſi, to be in his ſtead from age to age, as R. Moſes writeth.</hi> Which refuteth what ſome ſay, that the Preſident of the Sanedrim was alwayes a Prieſt; and ſheweth, that the chief ruler of the Commonwealth was ruler over perſons and cauſes of all kinds, without any diſtinction of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:123664:123"/> civil and eccleſiaſticall. In the 9. chapter we have theſe words; <hi>The Sanedrim conſisted of the chief of that people, as well as of the Priests and Levites, becauſe the chief cauſes of that Commonwealth, as well as of religion, paſſed through their hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tostatus,</hi> a great Papiſt and writer, upon Matth. 16. v. 19. will tell us the opinion of his party: <hi>In the old Teſtament a diſtinction of juriſdiction was not neceſſary, becauſe it was one people &amp; one nation, and one temple where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all the Iewes did gather together: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince they could conveniently be governed, the unity of juriſdiction ſtanding, there ought not to have been a diſtinction: yea it was very convenient that there ſhould be an identity of juriſdiction, that it might be believed that it was the ſame God to whom they all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred. There was the ſame reaſon for the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for it was his will that there ſhould be one place in which they ſhould offer ſacrifice unto him; leſt if that had been done in many places, they might have thought there had been many gods.</hi> Stapleton <hi>de Prin. doctrin.</hi> 197. acknowledgeth the ſame indentity of juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among the Jewes.</p>
               <p>I come to the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> to Mr. Gilleſpies conceſſions; which are as large as I can wiſh: that the church &amp; ſtate were the ſame materially; that the ſame man was both high Prieſt and chief judge of the nation; that elders of ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:123664:123"/> did exerciſe coercive juriſdiction; that the Jewiſh Senat after the thirtieth year of Chriſt was eccleſiaſticall, and yet was over all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and cauſes, except capitall; and that there was not then any other ſenat extant; but that before the thirtieth year, the ſame ſenat having the judgement of capitall cauſes, was civil. All theſe being granted, I ſee not what further can be required in the behalf of unity of juriſdiction; ſince 1. the ſame men that were members of the eccleſiaſticall ſenat, were alſo members of the civil ſenat: 2. that the ſynagogues were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with magiſtracy, ſince the elders had a coercive power; ſo that in the very ſynagogues there is by his confeſſion a coalition of powers and juriſd ctions: 3. making but one ſenate both before and after the 30. year, which jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of all cauſes and matters, and over all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the civil before the 30. of Chriſt judging of eccleſiaſticall cauſes, and the eccleſiaſticall after the 30. judging of civil.</p>
               <p>But I could never underſtand why he calls the ſenate after the 30. year of Chriſt meerly eccleſiaſticall, becauſe it did not judge of capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall cauſes, though it had cognizance and judgement of all other matters Can the judging or not judging of capitall and criminall cauſes alter the conſtitution and name of an aſſembly or court, ſo as that when it judgeth of capitall cauſes it muſt be called civil, otherwiſe it muſt be called eccleſiaſticall?</p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:123664:124"/>
               <p>Now becauſe there is ſome obſcurity in that conceſſion of his, that the church and ſtate were the ſame materially, we will hear what his countrey-men ſay to that, in a late book printed anno 1657. called <hi>A true repreſentation of the preſent diviſions of the church of Scotland,</hi> that we may the better weigh his recantation, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther modification, when he ſaith, that though they were the ſame materially, yet they were diſtinct formally: the words are pag. 18. <hi>The church of God being reſtrained to that one peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Iſrael, their church and commonwealth were materially the ſame by divine conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo that none could be members of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth but ſuch as were alſo members of the church, and ſo profeſſours of the true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as now under the Goſpell it may be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</hi> Now let us hear Mr. Gilleſpie pag. 6. <hi>They were formally diſtinct in reſpect of distinct lawes; the ceremoniall was given to them in reference to their church ſtate, the judiciall was given to them in reference to their civil ſtate.</hi> But if they were diſtinct in regard of the judiciall and ceremoniall lawes, why may they not be united in regard of the morall law? For Mr. Gilleſpie paſſeth over the morall law, and leaves it uncertain who is to be the keeper and guardian of it, and whether it was given in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to their church ſtate or in reference to their civil ſtate, or whether a third power, juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction or ſtate muſt not be conſtituted, that is
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:123664:124"/> neither civil ſtate nor church ſtate, to which the morall law hath reference: for ſure there was ſome union of juriſdictions in the protection and defence of the morall law, which was as it were the bottom and the baſis upon which the ceremoniall and judiciall were grounded, and is of far more large extent then the ceremoniall and judiciall put together; and from which, in ſo many difficulties that are incident for the clearing of ceremoniall rites and judiciall ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, there muſt be continuall appeals to the keepers of the morall law; which being at leaſt equally in the cuſtody of the magiſtrate and church-officers, and both parties having a joint intereſt in the morall law, as to ſee all men and buſineſſes governed and ſquared thereby, they alſo to that end muſt conjoin their power and juriſdiction. For indeed the morall law is no more different from the politick, then from the law given to families, fathers, maſters, huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands; only the politick law is the practiſe of the morall, or is the morall law applicable to cities, families, &amp;c. In like manner the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall law is but the morall law applyed in the practiſe of religious ſervice: for the morall law ſaith, God only is to be worſhipped; the ceremoniall ſaith where, how, when &amp; by whom. So that as all lawes are ſtreams from the morall law, ſo muſt all juriſdiction be from one foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of magiſtracy. It ſeems that Calvin had the ſame thought, when in his harmony of the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuch
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:123664:125"/> he reduceth all lawes under one claſſis.</p>
               <p>But to examine a little nearer his diſtinction of materiall and formall; I do not underſtand what he meaneth by formall in oppoſition to materiall: for the juriſdictions that are one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially, muſt be alſo one formally. Let us ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe two coordinate ſupreme ſenates, as Mr. Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſpie would have them, among the Jewes, one civil, and another eccleſiaſticall; and that (as he would have it) the ſame men were mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of one and the other: I ſay, if they do not differ materially, neither do they differ for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, ſo long as no law, order or conſtitution, civil or eccleſiaſticall, can have any force with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the joint conſent of both, and except both ſenates put their ſeals of confirmation to what either of them hath decreed. For example, the appointing a day of publick humiliation by the eccleſiaſticall ſenate, muſt be alſo an act of the ſame men ſitting in a civil ſenate, who, if they will have the injunction to ſtand, muſt make orders ſubſervient to it, that there be no markets nor courts that day kept; otherwiſe thoſe that keep markets or courts upon ſuch a day by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of former warrants from the civil ſenate, will not know how far they are to obey the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the eccleſiaſticall ſenate, without a diſpenſation from the civil ſenate. This double juriſdiction is in effect but one; for the ſame men appointing a day of humiliation in an ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall ſenate to be kept, forbid alſo in a
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:123664:125"/> civil ſenate all markets and courts to be kept: and though one part of the injunction was made in one ſenate, and the other part in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenate; (which is very impertinent, and a needleſſe multiplication of buſineſſes) yet thoſe two juriſdictions muſt at length be reſolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an integrall one; as when Protectour, Lords and Commons, that make up one Parliament, muſt unanimouſly agree that all the votes and orders ſhall end in the ſame law and act. I confeſſe there can hardly be claſhing of powers, judgements &amp; votes, betwixt theſe two ſupreme ſenates, ſuch as Mr. Gilleſpie ſuppoſeth, ſo long as the ſame men are members of both ſenates; but withall I ſhould count it a needleſſe and ſenſeleſſe multiplication of ſenates, and that in vain the ſame matter and cauſe were to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by two coordinate ſenates, when as one ſenate would ſerve the turn: for however, at length the two ſenates, as they meet in the ſame perſons, ſo muſt they in the ſame accord and agreement; which is all one as if it were but one juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>Again, it is obſervable, that diverſity of things and perſons to which lawes and conſtitutions have relation, doth not conſtitute a diverſity of power and juriſdiction, ſpecially when the ſame men are to make the ſame lawes and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: for as the ſame men making lawes about navigation and the militia, cannot be ſaid to act from two powers and juriſdictions they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:123664:126"/> with; ſo neither if the ſame men do make lawes, as for example, about Gods worſhip, and the militia.</p>
               <p>Briefly, I believe Sir Thomas More in all his Utopia cannot parallel ſuch a piece of conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſtate, made up of two juriſdictions, both coordinate &amp; ſubordinate each to the other, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially the ſame, not formally, where of the ſame men are members. A happy ſtate indeed, in which there can be no claſhing, except the ſame man be oppoſite to himſelf, or that the members of the eccleſiaſticall ſenate forget to day, what they decreed yeſterday when they met in a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſenate. But ſince theſe two ſenates are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially the ſame men, what need we give them ſeverall names and formes, for ſome acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentall circumſtances of time and place, either becauſe they do not ſit in the ſame place, or that they are upon ſeverall buſineſſes? muſt the ſame members of Parliament, ſitting to day upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, be called an eccleſiaſticall ſenate, acting by an eccleſiaſticall power, and to morrow ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to order the militia of the ſtate, it may be in another place, be called a civil or military ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, acting by a civil or military power?</p>
               <p>But moſt of thoſe that are for eccleſiaſticall presbyterian juriſdiction, finding no probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the opinion of Mr. Gilleſpie, <hi>viz.</hi> that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jewes there was a juriſdiction in the hands of church-officers diſtinct from that of the magiſtrate, go another way, and admit wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:123664:126"/> an identity of juriſdiction, but withall ſay, that from the coalition of juriſdictions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Jewes, it cannot be inferred that the ſame ought to be under the Goſpell; that that church in its pedagogy is no pattern to the church in its maturity: thus ſpeaketh Amyraldus in his book of the government of the church chap. 3. p. 91. <hi>Whoever commits</hi> theſe two powers <hi>into the hands of the ſame perſons, he not only brings back the church into its infancy, as if it were ſtill under the pedagogy of the law, but alſo casts it into that confuſion from which the condition of thoſe times did deliver it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A man upon better grounds may invert this paralogiſme, and make uſe of this reaſoning of Amyraldus to prove the quite contrary to what he drives at; and ſo imitate ſmiths, who with the ſame tool pull out &amp; drive in a nayl: for had the Jewes had a government of the church diſtinct from that of the Commonwealth, I would thence inferre, there is no further need among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of ſuch a diviſion, but rather of a coali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of powers; that the Jewes being rude and weak in knowledge, under a burdenſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, loaden with ceremonies and legall rites, where the ſixth part of the people was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther judge, elder, leader, Prieſt, Prophet, Levite, or officer in the Leviticall ſervice, had need to have many keepers, guardians, tutours, many helps of government; ſo the governours might be very well parted into eccleſiaſticall and civil,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:123664:127"/> and ſo the whole government might be ſhared betwixt the two ſupreme powers, the keepers of each having wherewithall to employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: but the Chriſtian church being wholly freed from the burdenſome adminiſtration of lawes and officers, and having no platform of government, neither hath it need of an ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall juriſdiction, when there is no eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall law or conſtitution.</p>
               <p>Thus, were I of Mr. Gilleſpies opinion, that among the Jewes the government of the church was diſtinct from that of the Commonwealth, I would ſpeak in the language and words of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myraldus, and infer, that for the ſame reaſon that the Jewes had a double juriſdiction, the Chriſtians may be very well without it.</p>
               <p>But the opinion of Amyraldus, that there was no diſtinction of juriſdiction among the Jewes, rendereth his inference for a double juriſdiction under the Goſpell much more groundleſſe, weak and abſurd: for if under a burdenſome adminiſtration, when they had need of many pedagogues, and ſchoolmaſters, yet they were governed without diſtinct government of church and ſtate; much leſſe do the Chriſtians need ſuch a diſtinct government, ſeeing they are freed from the neceſſity of having ſo many ſchoolmaſters, guides, watch-men, and maſters, to govern them, and teach them ſo many rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and unriddle them all the ceremonies: beſides that, ſure God never gives diſtinct gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:123664:127"/> but alſo he giveth a diſtinct law and diſcipline, to be a rule to govern by; which yet God never did.</p>
               <p>Though I am ſo far of the opinion of Amy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldus, that the government of the church was not diſtinct from that of the ſtate; yet I am not of his mind in this, to think that identity of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment would bring a confuſion in Chriſtian ſtates: for I count that identity ſo needfull and neceſſary, whether the ſtate be never ſo much or never ſo little burdened by men, lawes, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, and buſineſſes to diſpatch, that in a ſtate loaden with lawes and buſineſſes, as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of the Jewes was, two juriſdictions coordinate would have brought an horrible confuſion, and multiplication of ſuits and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and in a ſtate leſſe incumbered with lawes and buſineſſes, that double juriſdiction would ſtill bring more work then need be if there was but one juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>The argument of Mr. Gilleſpie, to prove that there were two coordinate juriſdictions among the Jewes, becauſe of the wide diviſion and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of offices amongſt them, neither the King being to take upon him the Prieſthood, nor the Prieſt the Kingdom, as it makes nothing for him, ſo doth it rather plead for an identity of juriſdiction under the new Teſtament: for if when the functions were ſo diſtinct, that the King could not offer incenſe and be Prieſt, nor the Prieſt King, yet there was no diſtinction of
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:123664:128"/> juriſdictions; much leſſe is that diſtinction need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full under the new Teſtament, when nothing hinders but that Kings may be miniſters, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters Kings.</p>

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:123664:128"/> themſelves a right of church-ſucceſſion and Baptiſme, they will acknowledge the Romiſh church to be a true church, and yet with ſuch metaphyſicall reſervations and modifications, that from a metaphyſicall goodneſſe they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly deſcend to a morall, making of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates power an eccleſiaſt call, of a cadaver and carkaſſe a living body, of an aggregation of churches under one presbytery of the ſame extent with the juriſdiction of the magiſtrate, the only true church of Chriſt. This made the late Engliſh hierarchy conceive, that their beſt courſe was to approach as near as they could to the Romiſh, yea to be one church with them; that otherwiſe they could not make their power, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ſucceſſion good, nor clear themſelves from the guilt of ſchiſme. So that as all parties have been equally miſtaken in their grounds, ſo have they hardly underſtood one another, raiſing doubts where there were none; ſome by that weakning their own cauſe, and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening that of their adverſaries, who took all conceſſions for truths, putting their oppoſites to very great ſtraights. For not knowing well how to deny the church of Rome to be a true church, and that ſalvation is to be had in it; and not being able to ſhew an uninterrupted ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion from the Apoſtles time, as the Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts can do, nor vindicate themſelves from ſchiſme; each party is very eager to call his neighbour ſchiſmatick, rending the ſeamleſſe
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:123664:129"/> coat of Jeſus Chriſt, that name being liberally beſtowed by the Romaniſts upon the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, and by ſome of theſe upon thoſe that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the diſſenting brethren: each of them, Papiſts and Presbyterians, challenging that ſeamleſſe coat of Chriſt, even right of church and eccleſiaſticall power; and therefore for fear of ſchiſm &amp; rendings, they will be ſure to caſt lots upon it, that they may have it whole and entire. Whereas had both been well informed of the nature of church and of ſchiſme, and that ſuceeſſion is a needleſſe plea, neither availing the Romaniſts a whit, nor prejudicing any way the reformers, Baronius, Bellarmin, &amp; Stapleton, as well as Whitaker, Chamier, and the like, might have ſaved the world ſo much labour in reading them; the firſt in putting the reformers upon the task of proving themſelves a true church, and the latter in taking off the aſperſion of ſchiſmaticks: for then no doubt all the hard task had been on the Romaniſts ſide, who being not able to make invalid our grounds about the nature of the church, the power of the church, the calling of paſtors, their ſucceſſion, and of ſchiſme, had been wholly put upon vindicating themſelves, and not weakning our title; for it had been to little purpoſe, ſo long as we had retained the ſame grounds, which do put us into a firm and unmoveable poſſeſſion. About the nature of ſchiſme Dr. Owen (whoſe grounds, which is very ſtrange, though we never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred

And having in my <hi>Paraeneſis</hi> han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled the nature of the church, &amp; intending here only an extract of it, I will ſay only ſo much of it as will make way to what I mainly intend to prove, <hi>viz.</hi> that the parity and independency of churches each from the other in power of exerciſing all church acts, beſt agreeth not only with Scripture, antiquity, and the opinion of Zuinglius, Muſculus, Bullingerus and Eraſtus, but alſo with the ſenſe of the ſeven diſſenting brethren, ſitting twelve years agone in Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter together with the other members of the aſſembly of Divines; yea that many forrain divines, and other learned men, Salmaſius for one, no way intending to favour the cauſe we have in hand, have been ſtrong patrons of it in ſeverall of their writings, and treating of the right of churches and of the power of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate over them, have laid the ſame foundations as we.</p>
               <p>I find in holy writ, ſpecially in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the word <hi>Church</hi> is taken properly three wayes. I. for the myſticall body of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, the elect, juſtifyed and redeemed, whereof the Goſpell is full; thus Hebr. 12. v. 23. and Epheſ. 5. v. 26, 27. &amp;c. II. for the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſality of men through the world outwardly
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:123664:130"/> called by the preaching of the word, yielding an externall obedience to the Goſpell, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing viſibly Chriſtianity; of this mention is made 1 Tim. 3. v. 15. and 2 Tim. 2. v. 20. III. for a particular viſible congregation, with one accord meeting in one place for the worſhip of God according to his inſtitution; which is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Rom. 16. v. 4. Gal. 1. v. 2. 1 Cor. 16. v. 1. 2 Cor. 8. v. 1. 1 Theſſ. 2. v. 14. Act. 9. v. 31. Act. 15. v. 41. 1 Cor. 16. v. 19. yea ſuch a church as is confined within a private family, as Rom. 16. v. 5. St. Hierome upon the 1. of the Galatians takes the word <hi>church</hi> properly ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for a particular church, or for that church called the Body of Chriſt, which hath neither ſpot nor wrinkle: <hi>dupliciter eccleſia poteſt dici; &amp; ea quae non habet maculam &amp; rugam, &amp; vere eſt Chriſti corpus, &amp; ea quae in Chriſti nomine congregatur;</hi> relating to the words of Chriſt Matth. 18. v. 19. <hi>where two or three,</hi> &amp;c. which cannot be underſtood of a nationall church.</p>
               <p>There be two places in the new Teſtament where the word <hi>church</hi> is taken otherwiſe: namely Act. 19. v. 41. for a concourſe of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; &amp; Matth. 18. v. 17. a place ſo much contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and which when we ſpeak of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication requireth we ſhould inſiſt upon it. It ſufficeth here to ſay, that if by it were meant an eccleſiaſticall aſſembly of paſtors and elders, ſome other parallel to it might be found in the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:123664:130"/> old or new Teſtament. I am ſure as there is none in the new, ſo neither in the old; where the words <hi>kahal</hi> or <hi>gnedah</hi> are taken ſometimes for the whole congregation, as Deuter. 31. v. 30. where Moſes pronounced a canticle in the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the whole church or congregation; and yet the 28. verſe ſheweth that by the whole congregation the magiſtrates and elders are meant: thus Levit. 4. v. 13, 14, 15, and 21. where if the people had treſpaſſed ignorantly, the church, that is the aſſembly of magiſtrates and elders, are commanded to offer atonement for the ſin; and Deut. 23. v. 1. the eunuch, the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard, the Moabite and the Ammonite are barred from the congregation or the church, that is from publick employment; for a converted Moabite was not forbidden from the Jewiſh church. Sometimes for a ſenat of judges and magiſtrates, called <hi>Synedrium;</hi> as Proverb. 26. v. 26. and ſo it is interpreted by the LXX. and there you have a plain expoſition of the word <hi>church</hi> Matth. 18. for the like cauſe of wrong and injury is ſpoken of in both places, and the like judicatory: ſo Eccleſiaſticus 23. v. 24. the adultereſſe is convented before the <hi>church,</hi> that is before the judicatory of judges and el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Which places manifeſtly declare, that Chriſt meant ſuch a judicatory amongſt the Jewes, whereof the words <hi>heathen and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> make further proof; and that Jeſus Chriſt ſpoke of the ſame kind of judicatory and men,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:123664:131"/> as ordinarily were found when he ſpoke the words: but it is evident that neither in Chriſts time, nor ever ſince his time, the word <hi>church</hi> was taken for an aſſembly or ſenat of eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calls, or an aſſembly of paſtors. So that, was there any ſuch ſentence of excommunication or cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure inflicted by the church upon the party that did the wrong, this judgement or ſentence muſt needs be pronounced by ſuch a Synedrium or ſenat of judges and elders, endowed with judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall authority, as the word <hi>church</hi> was uſually taken for among the Jews. But ſuppoſe the word <hi>church</hi> was not uſed by Chriſt in that ſenſe, our brethren ſhould ſhew us that Jeſus Chriſt did ſpeak it in a Scripture ſenſe, and as it was taken in the writings of the Evangeliſts and Apoſtles, namely (as they would have it) for an aſſembly of Chriſtian church-officers inveſted with judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall authority. Here one controverted place of Scripture muſt be expounded by another: and while there is very great likelyhood that Jeſus Chriſt meant a ſenat ordinarily ſitting amongſt the Jewes to decide controverſies of wrong be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt brother and brother, and which was not made up of officers diſtinct from the magiſtrate, or men delegated by him; if they will weaken our plea and expoſition, which is very rationall and naturall, and make it as probable and likely that he ſpoke of a company of church-officers diſtinct from the magiſtrate, they muſt look out ſome parallel place either in the old or new
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:123664:131"/> Teſtament, where the word <hi>church</hi> is ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; which I am confident they will never find.</p>
               <p>But to yield as much as I can; though I find no where in the old Teſtament the words <hi>kahal</hi> and <hi>gnedah, church,</hi> ſignifying ſuch an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of church-officers, yet I find 1 Sam. 19. v. 20. the word <hi>lahakath</hi> mentioned, where it is ſpoken of a company of Prophets, which word our brethren might as well interpret a <hi>church:</hi> but neither would this ſerve their turn; for in that place of Samuel quoted, thoſe prophets were not ſitting in a ſenat, church or colledge, nor were they about any church act, but were travelling in the high-way: and however, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt had no reference to ſuch a church or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of prophets, who as prophets were never endowed with a judiciall power. Samuel indeed was over them as an Arch-prophet; but as ſuch he had no juriſdiction in Iſrael, but as a Prince and Judge of the people.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That a particular aſſembly of Chriſtians meeting in one place about the worſhip of God, is the only true viſible church men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in Scripture. That that church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as an aſſembly of Chriſtians, bringeth forth other kinds of acts then it
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:123664:132"/> doth conſidered as a ſociety of men: by which the nature and extent of the power of a private church is made clear and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving mentioned the acceptions of the word <hi>Church</hi> in the new Teſtament; there being not any viſible aſſembly either according to the firſt or ſecond acception, it remaineth, that a particular aſſembly of Chriſtians meeting in one place with one accord, about the worſhip of God, enjoying the ſame ordinances, hath the true denomination of a church. This church, presbyterian, particular church or congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, is the true adequate ſubject of all church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, diſcipline and power; which it enjoyes partly by a divine poſitive right, as it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Chriſtians, partly by a divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall civil politick right, as it is a ſociety of men endowed with wiſedome, prudence and liberty, to govern themſelves by ſuch lawes as they find moſt convenient for their ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence.</p>
               <p>The firſt is a divine poſitive right: for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever men are ſo, or otherwiſe commanded by ſome externall power, yet the paſtor is to look for a flock and people, and the people for a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor; and both are to meet in as convenient a place and competent a number as they can, to enjoy the ordinances of Chriſt, by hearing the word, praying, and partaking of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:123664:132"/> by a warrant and command from Chriſt. By the ſame right, warrant and command, the paſtor or paſtors of the church are to perform all the paſtorall acts, as to preach to thoſe that will hear, not by conſtraint, but willingly, to command in the name of Chriſt, to exhort, to dehort, to beſeech men to be reconciled to God, to lay out Chriſt in the promiſes of the Goſpell, to denounce the judgements of God to the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent and unbelievers, to admit to the Euchariſt all baptized perſons, and viſibly profeſſing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, who are not ignorant, or publick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous offenders', or profane, refuſing none by any judiciall act of theirs denouncing ſentence of excommunication, or any other cenſure, but by their generall duty as Chriſtians, by which they are bound not to have communion with ſuch unfruitfull workers of darkneſſe. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they are to impoſe nothing, no injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, no cenſure or puniſhment, but on ſuch as without conſtraint and willingly undergo it, and are contented ſo to do. The other acts of a paſtor out of the congregation are, to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himſelf, ſent or unſent, to viſit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the ſick, the priſoner, the widow, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe, to ſee all perſons and families that are of his flock, to be the ſame at home as at church, of the ſame Goſpell-converſation, and that all ranks be filled with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Lord, to reſpect no mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or perſon in delivering his meſſage from
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:123664:133"/> Chriſt, ſaying even as John Baptiſt to Herod, <hi>it is not for thee to keep thy brothers wife;</hi> briefly, to do the office of a faithfull miniſter in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>The acts of the people in a ſociety of church-members are double; ſome do reſpect the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, others the fellow-members. Thoſe that reſpect the paſtor or paſtors are, to maintain, obſerve, reſpect and honour them, firſt for their callings ſake, looking upon them as Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours from Chriſt, and then for their work, and the word that they bear; to receive their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands as commands of Chriſt, and yet not with a blind obedience, but firſt being perſwaded and convinced, yea judging them by the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſpirituall men, and by a judgement of diſcretion and approbation, proving the paſtors doctrine, though it came out of another St. Pauls mouth.</p>
               <p>The acts and duties of church-members as ſuch one towards another are, to love, edifie, forbear, and ſubmit one to another. But a main act of a church-member as ſuch is, not to ſubmit his own reaſon to the number of his fellow-members, in aſſenting to or diſſenting from ſuch a doctrine, act, or law made by them, but to the weight, and to what he by his reaſon inlightened by the word conceiveth to be moſt good, true, juſt and reaſonable; yet, for conformity ſake and mutuall edification, yielding as far as he may.</p>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:123664:133"/>
               <p>The acts of the power of the church by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall divine politick civil right, not as they are Chriſtians or church-members, but as they are a ſociety of men endowed with humane prudence, freedom of body and mind, and have diſcretion as to govern themſelves and their private fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, ſo to contribute their advice and help to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the government of any ſociety of men, whereof they are members, theſe acts, I ſay, are common to all other ſocieties, as to a company, a hall, a corporation, a colledge or ſchool: theſe acts are, to do all things orderly; to chuſe their own church-officers; that orders made by the major part of the ſociety ſhall oblige the minor diſſenting part; to chuſe time and place of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; to admit or reject ſuch officers or members as the major part of the members ſhall think fit; that each member ſhall ſtand to any order of the diſcipline once conſented unto by him, till the order be reverſed by the conſent of the major part.</p>
               <p>All theſe acts are to be guided not only by the light of reaſon and common prudence, but chiefly by that meaſure of light of grace or faith that God hath imparted to every church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; which light being not known but to him that hath received it, and the ſprings and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives which induce each member of a church-ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety rather to be of this then of that judgement, in ordering and governing the ſociety, being unknown to the univerſality of the ſociety;
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:123664:134"/> therefore church-members are to be governed as the members of any other ſociety, by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate of men as men, and not as Chriſtians, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, either actively or paſſively, to an order and law, becauſe it is an order and law, not becauſe it is good and reaſonable. It is better in ſuch things, as they ſay, that a miſchief ſhould happen then an inconvenience: for if one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, though alone in the right, ſhould diſſent from the reſt of his fellow-members, no man but will judge that it is much better that this one diſſenting member ſhould ſubmit to that which is wrong, either by acting or ſuffering, then that all proceedings for order and diſcipline ſhould be ſtayed. Were no law valid but to him that thinketh it ſo, the world would be in a ſtrange confuſion.</p>
               <p>So then, an aſſembly of Chriſtians being a ſociety of men, and a Chriſtian having the face like a lawyer, a phyſitian or a merchant, and nothing being ſeen but the out-ſide, they muſt be all governed by the ſame dictate, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth <hi>prima fronte</hi> to be reaſon to a man conſidered as a man, and not as he is a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, lawyer or phyſitian. And as Dionyſius go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned his Kingdom and ſchool by the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of reaſon; ſo muſt a ſociety of merchants, a colledge of phyſitians, a family, and ſo a ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Of theſe two kinds of acts, as every ſociety hath one proper to it ſelf, as it is a ſociety of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:123664:134"/> merchants, phyſitians, lawyers, Chriſtians; ſo one kind of theſe acts is common to all, as they are equally a ſociety of men, that muſt have a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and magiſtracy ſet up within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and ſo muſt a ſociety of Chriſtians meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the worſhip of God, have.</p>
               <p>But to make it evident that all church-acts are not acts of men as church-members, but as members of a ſociety, and not as Chriſtians, but as inveſted with magiſtracy, either aſſumed by a confederate diſcipline, or delegated, I might inſtance the like neceſſity of two kinds of acts in all ſocieties of men that can be imagined, not conſidered as Chriſtians. For example, theſe two kinds of acts will be found in a colledge of phyſitians, who, as phyſitians, joyn in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation upon a caſe propounded to them, ſend bills to their apothecaries, examine and judge of the worth of thoſe that are candidates, or have licenſe to practiſe phyſick, diſcourſe of their art either aſunder, or in a body as in a conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but as a ſociety of men inveſted with ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction and magiſtracy, they chuſe a preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, cenſors and officers; they make choiſe of time and place to ſit; they do all things orderly; they admit or expell members; they give autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and licenſe to practiſe phyſick; they bind themſelves to ſtand to thoſe orders that are made by the major part of their fellows; which act is no act of phyſitians as phyſitians, but a dictate of any other ſociety, who uſually take that for
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:123664:135"/> a law of the ſociety that hath paſſed by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part of their members. By this (by the way) we ſee what plea ſynods (except they be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, as the ſynod of the Apoſtles was) can have for making decrees and canons by an ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall juriſdiction, it being in truth no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then what is aſſumed by all ſocieties, whoſe orders do paſſe for lawes as to themſelves, if made by the major part of their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
               <p>But ſome of our brethren will interpoſe, and ſay, that if the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath appointed a ſet rule for governing of particular churches, as ſome of them are of opinion, and this rule be not arbitrary, nor left to the dictate of mens common reaſon &amp; prudence, then it followeth, that thoſe acts for taking care that thoſe ſet rules of Chriſt for government be according to the mind of Chriſt, are duties of church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers as ſuch, and not as members of a ſociety. To this I anſwer, were it ſo that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt had appointed an exact and expreſſe rule for government in particular churches, I confeſs that thoſe acts, to ſee the mind of Chriſt fulfilled, are acts of church-members as ſuch, ſo far as both paſtor and members do act in obedience to God, and not unto men, not by conſtraint, but willingly; for ſo the preaching and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word are to be performed by church-members as ſuch: but theſe ſame acts, ſpecially about government, as far as they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:123664:135"/> and impoſed, and require externall obedience, and that the conſtitutions that are made about them are acts of the major part of the members, are valid not becauſe they are lawes of Chriſt, and approved to every ones conſcience, but becauſe like lawes and orders of other ſocieties, they do oblige as ſuch, and as conſented unto in the making of them by the major part of the members, though it may be the minor part were in the right; for as the acts of a magiſtrate commanding things directly commanded by God are the magiſtrates acts, ſo thoſe acts performed in a particular church, though commanded expreſſely by God, in as much as they require externall obedience, either actively or paſſively, are acts of that magiſtracy ſet up in that church.</p>
               <p>I find in a reſult of a ſynod in New-England, printed at the end of the book of Mr. Cotton of the Covenant of Grace, ſome concluſions whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſonant to what I now write in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of the two kinds of acts that are performed in every particular church, the one done by them as church-members, the other being an effect of magiſtracy ſet up in every particular church, conſidered not as a church, but as a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. The firſt kind of acts is proper to thoſe church-members, who by any power of magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy are not put upon ſtronger engagements of oredience then if there had never been any. The ſecond is exerciſed by magiſtracy, either in the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:123664:136"/> church, or out of the church, againſt the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and unruly, and ſuch as need to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled. I find the ſynod ſpeak much to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; namely p. 40. the collectour ſaith from them, that for remedying diſorders, and taking away or preventing groſſe errors, there muſt be a power of reſtraint and coercion uſed; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that every particular church is to be as well conſidered in the quality of a civil ſociety, as a ſociety of church-members.</p>

This ſame is proved by reaſon, and by the teſtimony of Mr. Burroughs, writing the ſenſe of all his brethren, as alſo by the practiſe of the churches in New-England.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHen at firſt I undertook to write of this ſubject, I had no other deſigne but to aſſert the nullity of a double externall juriſdiction, and to prove that, there being no ſuch thing, neither in Scripture nor reaſon, as an eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall power, all juriſdiction that was not united
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:123664:136"/> under and appertained not to the magiſtrate, &amp; was not a power of coercion, was no juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

But being not able to ſtudy my main matter intended, without enquiring into the nature of the power that both parties aſſumed to themſelves, I found that the tenets of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the congregationall way could very well accord with mine, and, which was not yet by any conſidered, that the right of particular churches, as the diſſenting brethren hold, might very well conſiſt with that meaſure of power that Eraſtus, Bullingerus, Muſculus, Gualterus, Grotius, Mr. Selden, &amp; Mr. Coleman allowed to the magiſtrate in matters of religion and over churches; and that independency of private churches (I mean independency from presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian claſſicall and ſynodicall judicatories) doth no way hinder their right and liberty, nor their
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:123664:137"/> dependency on the magiſtrate, nor cutteth ſhort the magiſtrate of the ſoveraign power he ought to have overall ſocieties and perſons, and in all cauſes and matters. Laſtly, I found that this way of reconciliation was moſt agreeable with Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, reaſon, the practiſe of the Jewes, and of the primitive church of Chriſtians; beſides was confeſſed ſo by many learned men, who though ſeemingly otherwiſe affected, and carried by more heat, then knowledge of what was paſſed or held in this Iſland, have notwithſtanding in their tracts about the power of churches, and diſcipline, laid the ſame grounds that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting brethren have delivered.</p>
               <p>I need not be very long in proving, by reaſon that this reconciliation betwixt the advocates of the magiſtrates power in matters of religion, and thoſe that plead for the right of churches, is already made to our hands by what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready handled. I adde further theſe following conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Since every private church hath within it ſelf a power of magiſtracy, and that all magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy, in whatever ſociety it be ſeated, is ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to the magiſtrate of thoſe ſocieties; it doth conſequently follow, that that magiſtracy wherewith every private church is inveſted, is alſo ſubordinate to the magiſtrate: for, as I have demonſtrated, ſince no ſociety of church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, (no more then of citizens, merchants, phyſicians and the like) can be imagined with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:123664:137"/> lawes, diſcipline, and power of reſtraint and coercion, ſo neither can it be imagined that ſuch a power is not dependent on the magiſtrate: for if a member of a ſociety be obſtinate and refractory, and will not be ruled but by coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion and compulſion, &amp; it be more then church-members as ſuch can do, to reduce him by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation and good advice; then church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers muſt act alſo by a power of magiſtracy, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſumed or delegated: however it be, that power of magiſtracy is ſubordinate to the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign magiſtrate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a maxime in Scripture, Philoſophie and common reaſon, that theorems or propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions that are true aſunder, are no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory one to another. Now theſe two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing propoſitions are of an undeniable truth, <hi>viz. The magiſtrate is a ſoveraign governour over all perſons and ſocieties, and in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and cauſes, whether they pertain to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion or no;</hi> and this, <hi>Every particular church hath a right and power to govern it ſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any dependence either on other churches or church-judicatories.</hi> Each of theſe propoſitions being conſidered as true aſunder, muſt alſo be very conſiſtent, and no way claſhing one with the other.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the right of churches may well ſtand with the power of the magiſtrate, may appear by example of many ſocieties, as families, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations, halls, whoſe intrinſecall power of
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:123664:138"/> magiſtracy agreeth exceeding well with that of the magiſtrate over them: for none doubteth but every father of a family hath a power to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern his children, houſhold and ſervants as he liſteth, being in his own as it were houſe a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate and a Prieſt; yet none hitherto queſtioned but that paternall and oeconomicall powers are ſubordinate to the power of the magiſtrate, for even the civil law and ſo many conſtitutions about regulating the power of fathers, maſters and husbands, and yet allowing them their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority at home, are an argument that their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly power is conſiſtent with their ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the magiſtrate.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There be, as I ſhewed above, two kinds of acts to be performed in a church; one as they are church-members, the other as they are a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, that for their government muſt aſſume ſome part of juriſdiction of the ſame nature with the magiſtrates power. In the managing of the acts of the firſt kind there is no ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the church to the magiſtrate, but only in the ſecond: for preaching, hearing the word of God, adminiſtring the ſacraments, walking holily, ſubmitting one to another, are no acts of power ſubordinate to the magiſtrate; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that conſideration I will grant the right of churches not to depend on the magiſtrate: but as theſe acts in a church-way cannot be exerciſed without a power of magiſtracy aſſumed, in this regard a church may be ſaid to be ſubordinate
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:123664:138"/> to the fountain of magiſtracy. For it is with theſe two kinds of acts in ſubordination to God and the magiſtrate, as with the body and the ſoul. For none doubts but the faculty and gifts of reaſoning, apprehending truth, loving God and our neighbour, believing in Chriſt, are no acts ſubordinate to the power of the magiſtrate: but as reaſoning, faith, love, muſt be ſuppoſed reſident in the body of man, and that the man in doing acts ſubordinate to the magiſtrates power, as going, ordering, commanding and obeying, doth carry along his reaſon, faith and love; in like manner, as it is not poſſible to conſider a man performing the acts of reaſon, faith and love, and not being the while ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to the power of the magiſtrate; ſo a church even performing thoſe acts of church-members as ſuch, in as much as the ſecond kind of acts that are ſubordinate to the magiſtrate muſt be joyned with the firſt, cannot be conſidered without it be ſubordinate to the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If the power of churches were not ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to the magiſtrate, many inconveniences would follow. 1. That ſome churches ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by the magiſtrate and his acts of appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing time, place and ſtipends, ſhould not be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to him. 2. Or if he ſhould gather none, and beſides appoint no publick worſhip to take place in all parts of his dominions, but leave that wholly to the will of thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:123664:139"/> of their own accord, this, I ſay, would in a very ſhort time breed irreligion or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſme in moſt places and moſt tanks of men: for then it muſt be conceived, that not one of 20. would congregate of themſelves, &amp; that the 19. parts not being called upon, nor any way invited by publick ordinances ſet up in all places of mens abode, atheiſme or neglect of all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion would ſoon enſue in moſt parts. And a perſecuting magiſtrate, as in the primitive church, were ten times rather to be wiſhed, then one careleſſe and neglecting to ſet up ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances: for by one of theſe two wayes, either by perſecution, or by countenancing and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the worſhip of God, the magiſtrate cauſeth religion to flouriſh; by doing neither one nor the other, he takes the way to aboliſh it, as Julian the apoſtate was about to do, if God had not the ſooner cut him off.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But ſuppoſe it be granted on all ſides, that the magiſtrate is bound to do what King Edward did or Queen Elizabeth, to baniſh popery, to ſet up proteſtantiſme and an orthodox mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery in all pariſhes throughout England (which acts cannot be performed by a few particular churches with all their church power;) ſure it muſt be alſo granted, that all thoſe acts of a magiſtrate in ordering affairs of religion are in his diſpoſall, and depending on him.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Since then the magiſtrate muſt have the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:123664:139"/> ordering of thoſe affairs of religion which he himſelf hath conſtituted, if he ſhould not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be the ſupreme governour of thoſe churches which he hath not erected, but were gathered by the members of churches of their own accord, there could not but a great confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ariſe in mens minds, as well as in the ſtate; it being no ſmall buſineſſe to diſtinguiſh the power of the churches that are ſubordinate to the magiſtrate, and the power of thoſe churches that are not.</p>
               <p>From reaſon I deſcend to the authority of the rever, brethren, both in old and new Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, diſſenting from the presbyterians. In old England the reverend pious Jeremie Burroughs will be in ſtead of all the reſt of his brethren; for in the eleventh chapter of his <hi>Irenicum</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth to deliver not only his own judgement, but alſo that of his brethren with whom he had occaſion to converſe. Whoever ſhall peruſe his book throughout, ſpecially the fifth chapter, will find that he attributeth as much power to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate over churches, as any of the oppoſites to the presbyterian brethren. Which power of the magiſtrate while he aſſerteth, he never conceives it ſhould overthrow his other poſitions, namely, in the ſeventh chapter, concerning the right and power of churches; or that his ſtating the right, liberty and power of churches, could not conſiſt with the power of the magiſtrate over them. Now he is very expreſſe in the ſaid
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:123664:140"/> chapter for the power of the magiſtrate in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred things.</p>
               <p>Pag. 21. he ſaith that magiſtrates in their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy are ſpecially to ayme at the promoting of the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt the mediatour; and there and throughout that long chapter you have theſe concluſions. 1. That the church and Commonwealth of Iſrael were mixed in one: that there is no reaſon it ſhould be now other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. 2. That the power of the magiſtrate is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like in the times of the old and new Teſtament; and were it ſo that nothing were ſet down of it in the new Teſtament, that it is enough it is a law not only granted to the Iſraelites, but alſo of the light given to the very heathens, whoſe power of magiſtracy was to govern religion as well as other things. 3. That it is moſt unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, that a magiſtrate turning either from the heatheniſh or Jewiſh religion, ſhould enjoy leſſe power in matters of religion then he had when he was a Jew or heathen. <hi>An infidel ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>converted to Christian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is thereby better inabled to perform the duty of his place, then before; but he had the ſame authority before.</hi> 4. He holds, that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate hath a ſoveraign judgement of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, though unskilfull in the things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. <hi>A magistrate that is not skilfull in phyſick or in navigation, yet he may judge phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians and mariners if they wrong others in their way.</hi> 5. He aſſerts largely the power of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:123664:140"/> the magiſtrate in matters of religion, by the example of the Kings of Judah and Iſrael, yea of the Kings of Niniveh, and of Artaxerxes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing his power in matters of religion, for which Ezra bleſſeth God; <hi>whoſoever will not do the law of thy God and the law of the King, let judgement be executed upon him.</hi> Here one may ſee, as the law of God and the law of the King may ſtand together, ſo the power of the magiſtrate may very well conſiſt with the power, right and liberty of a private church. And the like he doth by many paſſages of Scripture which he urgeth; namely Iſa. 49. v. 23. <hi>Kings ſhall be thy nurſing fathers,</hi> &amp;c. and Eſa. 60. 10. Revel. 21. v. 24. <hi>the Kings of the earth ſhall bring their honour</hi> to the church, and Rom. 13. 4. and 1 Pet. 2. 13. He addes, <hi>ſince the Scripture ſpeaks thus generally, for thy good, for the puniſhment of evil-doers and the praiſe of them that do well, we muſt not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh where the Scripture doth not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let us go to New-England, where none will deny but a power and right of churches is maintained ſutably to the ſenſe of the diſſenting brethren in old England, and yet they aſcribe no leſſe to the magiſtrate in matters of religion then Mr. Burroughs. Witneſſe the reſult of a ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod at Cambridge in new England, publiſhed an. 1646. They ſay, magiſtrates muſt and may command matters of religion that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Word, and forbid things therein
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:123664:141"/> forbidden; by the Word meaning the whole Word both in the new and old Teſtament. In ſhort, they hold for ſubſtance what I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the two kinds of acts performed in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry private church: one looking immediately at the externall act of the body, and the duties and ſins which appear in the carriage of the outward man; and this they ſay the magiſtrate looketh at, and commandeth or forbiddeth, in church and out of church; ſee pag. 15. and therefore they ſay pag. 40. every church conſidered as a civil ſociety needeth a coercive power. They ſay further, that this power is needfull in churches, to curb the obſtinate, and reſtrain the ſpreading of errours.</p>
               <p>Pag. 49. they invalid the example of Uzziah, often alledged by the Romaniſts and the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians (though Mr. Gilleſpie, as I remember, never maketh uſe of it in his great book) and ſay, that this act of Azariah thruſting out Uz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah was an act of coercion, and ſo of magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy, and a civil act, which prieſts and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites were allowed to do, and which they made ſubſervient to that command of God, that none ſhould burn incenſe but the ſons of Aaron. For I believe any officer under the ſoveraign magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate might do the like, in caſe this later ſhould go about to violate a command of ſuch a high nature; for being an under-magiſtrate, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with power of coercion, he obeyeth the greater maſter, and maketh uſe of his power to
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:123664:141"/> hinder a notable breach of Gods expreſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
               <p>Having thus made good that there is a fair correſpondency and concurrence of the right and power of private churches with the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates power over them, I do not ſee but my principles and thoſe of the diſſenting brethren are very agreeable &amp; conſonant in the main. It may be a few of them will call that power in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular church eccleſiaſticall, which I call a power of magiſtracy; and they will call excommunication an act of the eccleſiaſticall power, which I conceive to be rather an effect of the power of magiſtracy ſettled in every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar church. But the difference is not great, ſince we both make that church-power (call it what you will) a power of juriſdiction and coercion, which muſt needs be ſubordinace to the power of the magiſtrate, ſince both are of the ſame kind; and upon that account excommunication is a law of the power of coercion, &amp; ſo of magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. In ſhort, whereas ſome of them will ſay of all church-cenſures, that they are the product of a poſitive divine power, I ſay they are the reſult of a naturall civil power, ſubſervient to the divine power in the exerciſe of the firſt kind of acts of church-members as ſuch: &amp; ſure Mr. Burroughs and the reſult of the ſynod in New-England come very near, if not altogether to my ſenſe. For Mr. Burroughs pag. 27. maketh but two powers reſiding in a private church, one of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:123664:142"/> perſwading, deſiring, ſeeking to convince, the other a power reſtraining. This latter power I call a power of magiſtracy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by the firſt power men are not outwardly reſtrained nor rought to outward conformity; and accordingly, excommunication muſt needs be a product of that reſtraining power. So that the difference is not at all reall, but nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</p>
               <p>I find in Muſculus, in his common-places concerning magiſtrates, the ſame power of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy in churches. The paſſage hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged above: there he ſaith, that that power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in churches is noteccleſiaſticall, but the power of the magiſtrate.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>That a church made up of many particular churches under one presbytery inveſted with a judiciall power over them, is not of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Christ.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>VVE are brought inſenſibly to know the nature of a Chriſtian church inſtituted by Chriſt, which, as I ſaid, is a particular viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble one meeting in one place to celebrate the ſame ordinances, whereof mention is made 1 Cor. 11. v. 18. and chap. 14. v. 23. and Act. 13.
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:123664:142"/> v. 42. and 44. In this church the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath properly inſtituted the miniſtry: for Chriſt hath not inſtituted a catholick viſible church, much leſſe a nationall church under one presbytery: but this appellation of <hi>church</hi> is like the word <hi>man,</hi> which denotes a nature common to many ſingulars, and yet is properly ſaid of John or Peter. For as many fountains are not a fountain, and many ſchools are not a ſchool, and many families are not a family; ſo many private churches are not properly a church. We ſhall find below Amyraldus ſaying moſt truly, and very pertinently to our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the appellation of church doth not properly belong either to the catholick viſible church, or to a nationall church, ſuch as are the Engliſh, French, Helvetian churches; which are rather a knot or collection of churches, then a church.</p>
               <p>That ſuch a church, made up of many private churches under one presbytery, is not of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Chriſt, nor <hi>ex neceſſitate praecepti,</hi> but of the free pleaſure of each private church, who without any violation of the command of Chriſt, may either remain ſingle, or aggregate it ſelf to other churches under ſuch a presbytery, may be proved by ſeverall arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I begin with the teſtimony of the Rev. Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly in their humble advice, who lay no greater ſtreſſe of neceſſity upon it, then that it is lawfull and agreeable to the word of God that ſuch a thing be.</p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:123664:143"/>
               <p n="2">2. If the Lord Jeſus Chriſt had inſtituted ſuch a presbyterian church, it were fit it ſhould be told us what is a competent number of churches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to be under a presbytery, whether only three or four, or more, it may be two thouſand. If ſo many, why may not a hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand churches be under one presbytery? If ſo many, why not all private orthodox churches that are diſperſed through the world? If a preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery may be over all the catholick viſible church, ſince this presbytery muſt have a preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and overſeer, why may not this overſeer be called Biſhop? if Biſhop, why not Pope, who, in reference to his cardinall-conſiſtory, is the ſame as this Arch-preſident is related to his preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, both being over the whole catholick church?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath ſtated what number may conſtitute a private church, for where two or three are gathered in his name he hath promiſed to be in the midſt of them; and whatever number of men ſhall meet in one place, with one accord, in a church-way, to hear the word, it may be denominated a church, and have warrant from Chriſt to be ſo called. But our brethren cannot ſhew us that all the private churches of Scotland under one presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery can be called properly a church, being ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a politicall and prudentiall conſociation: and could they ſhew us that ſuch an aggrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is of the inſtitution of Chriſt, how can they
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:123664:143"/> diſprove, but that all the private churches in the world may be likewiſe by the inſtitution of Chriſt under one presbytery?</p>
               <p n="4">4. It being then equally the inſtitution of Chriſt, that 100000. yea all the churches of the world, as well as four or five thouſand (for ſo many may be in Scotland) ſhould be under one presbytery; were ſuch a presbytery not over all the churches of the world, but only over all the churches of France, Scotland and Holland, and inveſted with judiciall power from Chriſt to make lawes <hi>authoritatively,</hi> to excommunicate, to exauctorate, and inflict cenſures without any appeal, then this would be ſuch an <hi>Imperium in imperto,</hi> a juriſdiction within the juriſdiction of others, as our brethren the Scots have raiſed within the dominion and juriſdiction of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſt rate of Scotland. Such a presbytery, no doubt, might excommunicate as well one of the States of the United Provinces, as once the presbytery of Scotland did the Marqueſſe of Huntley, who 8. years after, <hi>viz.</hi> in the year 1616. was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed from that excommunication by the Arch-Biſhop of Canterbury in England; for which, I believe, he had as good warrant from Jeſus Chriſt, as the presbytery of Scotland had when they excommunicated him: and ſo both might by the like warrant excommunicate or abſolve any man ſentenced in the church of the Abyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins. And therefore it cannot be thought ſo mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous a thing in the Pope and his Conclave, to
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:123664:144"/> excommunicate the Emperour of Germany and the King of France, as they often have done: it being certain that a presbytery in Scotland hath no greater juriſdiction over one of the ſubjects of the magiſtrate of Scotland, then the Pope hath over the King of the Romans.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A thing very conſiderable it is, that the holy Scripture, as it often by the word <hi>church</hi> underſtandeth a particular church, ſo ſometimes (as 1 Corinth. 11. v. 22.) it meaneth the place where a particular church is aſſembled: but the Scripture, as it never means by the word <hi>church</hi> the place that containeth a nationall presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian church, ſo neither the nationall church it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is no leſſe conſiderable, that a true viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble church is not circumſcribed by the juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the magiſtrate, except that church be alſo the Commonwealth, and that he that is head of the church be alſo head of the Commonwealth; as it was with the people of Iſrael: for members of a particular church need not be dwellers in the ſame juriſdiction; it being ordinary beyond ſeas, for particular churches to be made up of members dwelling in ſeverall dominions, in the confines of Geneva, Savoy, Burgundie &amp; France.</p>
               <p n="7">7. But is there any command or inſtitution of Chriſt, that no more churches, or ſo many churches as are within one magiſtrates juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſhould be united under one presbytery?
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:123664:144"/> and that that presbytery, power of the keyes, and of binding and looſing, ſhould be bounded by the limits of the magiſtrates territory? If their power doth extend as far as heaven, no doubt it cannot be bounded by the limits of any earthly Prince.</p>
               <p n="8">8. This aggregation of many private churches under one presbytery is either voluntary, or commanded by God. If commanded, let our brethren bring us any paſſage of Scripture pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing a certain meaſure of judiciary power of the presbytery over private churches. If it be free and voluntary, and every private church may, without violation of divine preſcript, either aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate or not aſſociate, then thoſe churches can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be blamed if they forbear to aſſociate under one presbytery; and in caſe they ſhould aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate, if they be their own carvers, and do not enſtive their liberty to a power that is not of their own tempering and moulding. It is true, a woman hath no tye to marry, no more then a private church to aſſociate; ſhe hath that liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty either to ſubject her ſelf to the power of a husband, or remain ſingle: but ſhe cannot ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before or after ſhe is married put what condition ſhe pleaſeth to the power of a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. It is not ſo with private churches, who have no ſet rule of obedience due to the power of an eccleſiaſticall judicatory.</p>
               <p n="8">8. That this power of presbytery over many particular churches is a power of magiſtracy,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:123664:145"/> either aſſumed by common conſent or delegated from the civil magiſtrate, may be proved, in that under the heathen Emperours it was a power of conſent, every particular church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving to it ſelf ſuch a meaſure of power as they thought fit: and that it was ſo, we ſhall ſee (God willing) when we come to the hiſtory of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the power that the Chriſtian churches had under the heathen Emperours. But under Chriſtian Emperours no church-judicatory ever had any power but by commiſſion from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, as we ſhall likewiſe ſhew afterwards. And the diverſity of rites and cuſtomes of churches, as in faſting, keeping Eaſter, uſing divers formes of liturgies, forbidding of appeals from Africa to Rome, though all theſe churches were under the magiſtrates juriſdiction, doth ſhew, that as the ſupreme magiſtrate permitted many countreys to enjoy their cuſtoms &amp; muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall lawes, ſo did he the like for rites and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which every church took up as they liked beſt. Which is an argument that there was not ſuch a power as an eccleſiaſticall presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, binding all private churches to their conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, and that every church was independent; there being amongſt them no other conſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but only that which conſiſted in a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the ſame faith and doctrine.</p>
               <p n="9">9. As the intenſiveneſſe of the power of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall church hath ever been, and ought to be ſtill, ſo much as private churches were willing
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:123664:145"/> to yield, for they alwayes reſerved to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a full church-power, taking the decrees and conſtitutions of other churches rather as examples and friendly adviſes; ſo the extenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of that power hath been alwayes limited by the bounds of the magiſtrate, ſo that each church was more or leſſe independent, as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate over them had a larger or narrower ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory. If ſo many Kings as Moſes &amp; Joſua did ſubdue ſhould turn Chriſtians, ſo many inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent churches would there be, even 33. for ſo many were overcome; but ſhould all theſe 33. Kings be ſubdued, theſe 33. Churches would ceaſe to be independent on each other, and in ſtead of 33. churches depending each on their magiſtrate, one nationall church ſhould be moulded, of the ſame extent of power as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate that ruleth over them.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But we have him very expreſly teaching his ſcholars and auditors at Saumur, that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of a true viſible church doth properly belong to a particular church. I ſhall cite his words, <hi>Diſp. de eccleſiae nomine &amp; definitione,</hi> theſ. 28. in Engliſh: <hi>I know that a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and as it were a confederation of many the like ſocieties, which are aſſociated either by the ſame uſe of tongue, or the ſame form of Commonwealth, or elſe by the ſame govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſcipline, is called a particular church: thus we ſpeak of the French, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and German churches, as of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar churches, to diſtinguiſh them from that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall ſociety of Chriſtians which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all nations that bear the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: but, as we ſaid before, the word church is not proper to the ſociety of all Chriſtians, as it is to the particular aſſemblies of Chriſtians; ſo that conſequently we ſay that the word church is not to be ſaid in the like manner of a conſociation of many particular churches. Let
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:123664:148"/> then that communion which is between the churches of France be ſaid to be a church, and that the church is a confederation of many churches; for if taken according to the uſe of the holy Scripture, St. Paul calleth the ſeverall particular churches which were in Achaia, not by the name of the church of Achaia, or the Achaian church, but of the churches of Achaia.</hi> A paſſage very conſiderable, which force of turth hath drawn from the mouth of the greateſt enemy to the brethren: for their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt advocate could not ſay more in juſtification of what they have alwayes urged about the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the church, but could never be heard till of late; <hi>viz.</hi> that there was no true proper church but a particular church; that therefore a presbyterian nationall church made up of many particular churches under one presbytery, is not properly ſaid to be a church.

               <p>Salmaſius followeth the ſteps of Amyraldus, or rather Amyraldus of him, for Amyraldus wrote laſt. He is very large in his <hi>apparatus ad libros de primatu:</hi> and I ſhould be tedious to the reader, to ſet down here all that he hath
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:123664:149"/> handſomely ſtated about the nature of a church. I will only quote two pages, which are 265. and 266. The ſubſtance of his diſcourſe is comprehended under theſe 4 or 5 heads. 1. That all churches by right are equall in power and dignity, and are independent. 2. That the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation under the heathen Emperours was voluntary and by conſent. 3. That under Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Emperours a conſociation was introduced by humane right; ſo that what was at firſt by free and mutuall conſent, came afterwards un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Chriſtian Emperours to be of humane inſtitution and conſtitution. 4. That the unity of churches conſiſted not in an united collection of private churches, but in an agreement in faith and doctrine; for ſuch an union there is betwixt the Helvetian, Belgick and French churches, who agreeing in the ſame faith and doctrine, do notwithſtanding differ in diſcipline; ſo that theſe churches may be called independent each on the other, &amp; yet they keep an union and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion among themſelves. No other commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and independency do the reverend diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting brethren admit and practiſe, either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, or with the presbyterian churches both at home and abroad. 5. The fifth head is, that a conſociation of many particular churches joyned with the ſame band of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and under the direction, counſell, advice, not the command or judiciall power of any ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod or presbytery, doth much conduce to the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:123664:149"/> keeping the unity of faith, the band of charity, and the communion of ſaints. In the ſame place, and many others throughout his <hi>apparatus,</hi> he ſaith, that the communication betwixt particular churches was voluntary, and by way of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, every church reſerving to themſelves full right and power as to thoſe acts of their diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and the acts of binding and looſing; ſo that every church had power to take cognizance of any fact and crime committed in their body, to cenſure and excommunicate them, or recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them again, without any appeal to other churches or ſynods, except it were to beg their friendly interceſſion; for ſo they were wont to conſult and entreat Biſhops, and namely him of Rome, to review the ſentence, repairing to him as to an umpire, not a judge, to diſannull or evacuate the judgement: which makes the Romaniſts take thoſe applications to the Biſhop of ROme, as an acknowledgement of ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy over all the churches.</p>
               <p>To theſe authorities Iwill adde that of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and moderate Spanhemius, who did not uſe invectives as others, but arguments and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as good as he could; yet in my opinion the good man miſtaketh much in his Epiſtle to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid Buchanan, not ſo much through ignorance of the right, as of the fact: yet in the 55. page he hath theſe words, which are much to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the brethren. <hi>A particular church hath no power at all over another, but they
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:123664:150"/> are all collateral, and of equall right and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us now hear other advocates of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, before the word independency came to be given to Proteſtants in the world.

               </p>
               <p>John Meſtrezat, a very learned orthodox Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, lately deceaſed miniſter of Paris, goeth upon the ſame grounds with Ameſius in his book of the church written in French; and his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is moſt conſiderable, becauſe being a French-man, he could not know or foreſee, as Ameſius perchance might, any ſuch plea in England about right or power of churches ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregated.
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:123664:150"/> It would be too long here to ſet down his own words at large. For thoſe that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand French, they may ſee ſpecially the 1 chap. of the 3. book, where he ſaith that all power to do any church acts is placed in the particular church; that all church-priviledges and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes were made and granted unto, and in conſideration of a particular church aſſembled in one place. As for aggregation and conſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of churches, he holds it not to be grounded upon any pattern or command from Scripture, or even from a judiciall power given by Chriſt to claſſes, ſynods &amp; presbyteries over particular churches, but meerly aſſumed prudentially for mutuall preſervation againſt the common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and for keeping communion, as of ſaints, ſo of churches; that thoſe church judicatories were ſet up not for conſcience ſake, or in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to any preſcript of Chriſt, but for orders ſake; as the reverend man wrote to me but a few weeks before he died.</p>

That in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of Iſrael, at their firſt inſtitution, there were particular churches throughout all the land, near every families dwelling-place, called ſynagogues. 2. That theſe churches were independent both from any of their own, &amp; of the Prieſts or Levites judicatories. 3. That the while the magiſtrates power and juriſdiction re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained whoſe, entire and undivided, over all perſons, and in all cauſes and matters, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in ordering, ſettling and commanding the publick nationall worſhip of God.</p>

               <p>For the firſt, that ſuch churches were inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the land of Canaan, we have a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe proof Leviticus 23. v. 1, 2, and 3. <hi>Speak unto the children of Iſrael, &amp;c. ſix dayes ſhall work be done; but the ſeventh day is the ſabbath of reſt, an holy convocation, ye ſhall do no work therein, it is the ſabbath of the Lord in all your habitations.</hi> 1. We have here a convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and an holy one every ſabbath: 2. near every families dwelling place, at that diſtance which is called in the Goſpell a ſabbath-days journey; and to travell a ſabbath-days jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was equivalent to go as far as the houſe of convocation, which was eſteemed a fulfilling of the command Exod. 16. v. 29. <hi>abide every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the ſeventh day.</hi> For he that went no further then the place of convocation or meeting, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend on the ordinances, where they uſe to tarry from morning to evening, obeyed that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>let no man go out of his place on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day.</hi> For how could they keep a ſabbath-day holy, without an holy convocation? and how could that be frequented, and they not ſtir from their own place, except by <hi>not going out of his place</hi> be meant, not going any whither but to the place of convocation? For they could not keep the ſabbath without a holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation kept near every ones dwelling. Now that this convocation cannot be meant of natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and feſtivall meetings, is evident for thoſe

Now had they been bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to Jeruſalem every ſabbath-day, it would have been againſt the command, not to ſtir from their own places on that day.</p>
               <p>Theſe convocations or ſynagogues were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular churches aſſembled in a temple or houſe, called alſo ſchools or colledges, where Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and their ſons or ſcholars dwelt and taught daily: but on the ſabbath-day they had a more ſolemn meeting of all thoſe that dwelt near, for prayer, expounding of the law, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, conferences; the main action being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Rabbies: yet the diſciples were not ſilent, but ſate at their feet, asking queſtions, and hearing their anſwers and reſolutions: ſometimes a new comer in might interpoſe, as we ſee in the example of Jeſus Chriſt, Luke the fourth, who being unknown, had the priviledge to expound the Scripture, and to ask queſtions and give anſwers; ſo had St. Paul, as we read in the Acts of the Apoſtles chap. 13 v 15.</p>
               <p>But to ſpeak more particularly of the place, the teachers, and the matter and form of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in thoſe places of meeting or ſynagogues; I ſay, firſt one may trace the place in the old and new Teſtament. In the 26. Pſalm David ſaith, he will bleſſe the Lord in the congregations, and
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:123664:152"/> Pſal. 68. v. 26. <hi>bleſſe ye God in the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> which doubtleſſe ought to be underſtood of thoſe convocations in temples, which are called ſynagogues Pſal. 74. v. 8. <hi>they have burnt up all the ſynagogues of God in the land.</hi> Which texts make it good, that ſuch places for an holy convocation were erected through all the land. Calvin upon the place ſaith, that the people met in ſyngogues every ſabbath-day, to read and expound the Prophets, and call upon God by prayer. The 29. Pſalme v. 9. doth not obſcurely mention them, for the Pſalmiſt relates that while the works of God ſounded by haile, rain and thunder, the faithfull, not only under a ſhelter of ſtones and timber, but of Gods gracious provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and protection, did attend the ſervice of God. Of this Houſe and Temple David alſo ſpeaketh Pſal. 87. v. 2. <hi>The Lord loveth the gates of Sion, more then all the dwellings or tents of Iacob.</hi> The ſenſe of which words para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſtically I think to be this: although God gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with his bleſſing and preſence thoſe convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations which at firſt were kept under tents in the wilderneſſe, yet he is much more taken with that glorious manifeſtation of his between the cherubins, whereby God ſetteth out the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Alſo Salomon, Eccleſiaſtes 5. v. 1. and 2. ſpeaketh of theſe houſes or meetings, when he warneth men to be more ready to hear then to ſpeak in the houſe of God; intimating, that there was a freedome for the faithfull in
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:123664:153"/> thoſe convocations and ſynagogues, more then one, to ſpeak; and beſides that there were no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſacrifices performed in them, but thoſe of preaching, praying and thankſgiving.</p>
               <p>This houſe of convocation was alſo a place to train up diſciples, called the ſons of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, which were indifferently of all tribes; and therefore by the way, the miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, that do not ſucceed the Prieſts and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, but thoſe Prophets, who had neither ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation nor juriſdiction, cannot pretend other call or power then ſuch as theſe ſons of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets had So then theſe houſe or places for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation were alſo colledges and ſchools; and therefore Philo in the life of Moſes calleth them both <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

Huldah the prepheteſſe is ſaid to dwell in <hi>Bamiſchnah,</hi> in a colledge or ſchool of learning. So from 1 Samuel 19. v. 18. and 20. one may gather, that Samuel, being the chief Rabbi and Prophet, having many diſciples un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, had his houſe of oration, ſchool or Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge at Naioth in Ramah, where he did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teach publickly upon ſabbath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ayes, but alſo inſtructed upon other days his diſciples or young prophets, called his ſons, as appeareth by the 20. verſe; except by <hi>prophecying</hi> be meant ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:123664:153"/> marvellous things of Gods greatneſſe, goodneſſe, providence: for the ordinary gift and charge of the prophets was, not ſo much to declare hidden and foretell future things, as to expound the law, and to exhort the people, and pray with them; in which ſenſe John Baptiſt is called by Jeſus Chriſt a propher, who yet never wrote nor uttered any prophecies; and Exod. 7. v. 4. Aaron is called the prophet of Moſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was his interpreter to the people. And the great number of thoſe prophets ſheweth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly, that their ordinary employment was to do what the prophets of the new Teſtament do, to exhort, teach, comfort-rebuke; no leſſe number being required for that work under the old then under the new. In the 1 Kings ch. 18. when Jezabel did ſeek to deſtroy the Prophets, Obadiah hid 100. in a cave; and in the 2. book chap. 2. v. 16 the ſons of the Prophets ſead of their own body 50. men to ſeek after El jah. Sure there was no need of ſo many to foretell future things, when one of a 1000. Prophets might undergo that charge well enough, to ſatisfy all the people of the mind of God concerning future things, wherewith but few of the people need to be acquainted; but all the people had need of teachers and inſtructers in the law of Moſes, and that in a conſiderable number, for 1000. had not been enough to inſtruct the fourth part of the people in the ordinary way of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying, that is teaching and exhorting; for the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:123664:154"/> Rabbins ſay that there were 480. ſuch houſes of convocation or prayer, otherwiſe called ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, in Jeruſalem. There is mention made of two houſes which were famous, one at Bethel, the other at Jericho, whither the ſons of the Prophets repaired to Eliſha. They were frequented not only every ſabbath-day and new moon, for praying with the people of the neighbourhood, as appeareth by 2 Kings v. 22. but alſo for teaching their diſciples, and reſolving any that ſhould come to them upon any doubt: whither it is likely David did go Pſal. 73. v. 16. when being inwardly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed with diſtractions, he could find no ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, till he went to the ſanctuary of God, to be inſtructed better then he was; where by the ſanctuary doubtleſs is meant ſuch a houſe of convocation or ſchool. And in the 27. Pſalme, that one thing that David deſired of the Lord was, no doubt, to have communion with God and with the faithfull people in the Temple or houſe of prayer, whereto he reſorted every ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; for it is not likely he underſtood this of being partaker of the legall rites &amp; ſacrifices in the Temple at Jeruſalem, which was not yet built.</p>
               <p>What was the form and matter of the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes in thoſe houſes the Scripture mentioneth not: only we gather by what the Prophets of Baal did 1 Kings 18. v. 26. that likewiſe the Prophets of God in thoſe ſynagogues or houſes of convocation did pray from morning untill
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:123664:154"/> noon, and then till evening taught by catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and expounding; for in the 29. verſe the word <hi>propheſving</hi> is equivalent to teaching and inſtructing. And Samuel 1. book c. 12. v 23. ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth two parts of his propheticall office, <hi>viz.</hi> to pray, and teach: <hi>God forbid that I ſhould ſin against God, in ceaſing to pray for you; but I will teach you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as thoſe prophets had no dependence on the Prieſts and Levites, no more then the houſes of convocation where they taught; ſo neither do we read that there was any conſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all theſe convocations into one nationall church, under ſome church-judicatory made up of Prieſts and Levites, or that they had any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on the Sanedrim or ſtate-court, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing them any orders how to govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; only they were not to teach and expound ought but the law, whereof the magiſtrate was the keeper and guardian, nor to thwart the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the publick worſhip commanded, ſuch as were the killing of the paſſeover at ſet times, the appearing of the males three times in the year at the place that God was to chuſe, and performing all the ſacrifices, oblations and rites enjoyned: and ſo far were the convocations depending on the magiſtrate. For in the firſt inſtitution we do not read that theſe convocations or ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, or thoſe that were over them, were or needed to be inveſted with any juriſdiction, but were like ſchools of learning, whoſe maſters and
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:123664:155"/> teachers were alſo like Plato, Zeno, Ariſtotle, over the ſchools in Greece, who had ſcholars men of ripe years and diſcretion, that with a withing fulmiſſion embraced their ſayings and precepts; ſo that the Prince or Dr. of the ſchool needed not any reſtraining or coercive diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline to order them. And indeed it is very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that thoſe heatheniſh ſchools of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans had their firſt riſe and ouginall from thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> wiſh ſchools. But that each of thoſe convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations where Prophets taught and expounded were independent from other convocations, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only ſo far as they were all members of the ſame Commonwealth, will appear anone, when we enquire into the nature of theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations, when they went currently under the name of ſynagogues, and all jointly were not one Commonwealth in one countrey, but lived diſperſed: for then every lynagogue was <hi>ſui Iuris,</hi> and governed it ſelf; though ſome R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts would perſwade us that many ſynagogues were aggregated under one Archiſynagogue or chief <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>; which is a great miſtake, for ſome ſynagogues had ſometimes many Archiſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues. It is true, we read in the Theodoſian code of Patriarchs of the J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

'Tis true alſo that the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:123664:155"/> nature of thoſe ſynagogues being changed, as long as the Senat at Jeruſalem had any repute, other ſynagogues did defer very much to it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting letters of advice from them; but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted not to any command, as from a ſuperiour to an inferiour, as we gather by Act. 9. v. 2. and 3. and ch. 28. v. 21.</p>
               <p>But to follow the hiſtory of theſe convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions a little farther: their independency is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſeen when the faithfull people lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der idolatious Kings, as under Jeroboam and his ſucceſſours; for they could not depend on the Sanedum at Jeruſalem, ſince it was a capitall crime to appeal or repair about any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Jeruſalem, or attend at thoſe ſolemn meetings enjoyned by the law of Moſes three times in the year, and every ſeventh year: and therefore to keep themſelves free from idolatry, they frequented as much as they could thoſe places of convocation, as appeareth by a notable example 2 Kings 4. v. 22. For when the Suna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiſh woman deſired an aſſe to ride on to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſha, her husband told her, <hi>wherefore will you go to him to day? it is neither new moon nor ſabbath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The greateſt part of theſe houſes of convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (for ſome of them did not much alter from their firſt inſtitution, but remained ſchools and nothing elſe) in proceſſe of time did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly degenerate, but changed their nature, and laſted longer thus then in their firſt inſtitution,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:123664:156"/> and that begun from the time that they were led into captivity, and ſo continued under the Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians, Perſians, Grecians, and then the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans: for whereas at firſt they needed no other diſcipline then the law of their nation, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived vigour, ſtrength and protection from their own magiſtrate, who was a friend and protectour of their law, religion and liberty; when afterwards they lived under thoſe that were no good friends to their lawes and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and yet were ſuffered to enjoy them both, being diſperſed they were fain to alter the frame of their aſſemblies and convocations, and make of them ſo many little Commonwealths endowed with judiciall authority, yet retaining ſtill ſome prime face of a church or convocation, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides more mixture of ranks of men: for not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophets were governours and members, but alſo Prieſts, Levites and elders of the people, and all matters were handled as in a court of magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy; and yet reading and expounding of the law was not forgot, as we ſee Act. 13. v. 27. and ch. 15. v. 21. Nor was it grown out of uſe for ſcholars or young Prophets to ſit at the feet of the Rabbins, and receive inſtructions, as St. Paul at the feet of Gamaliel Act. 22. v. 3. and Marie at the feet of the Lord Jeſus; or for the young Prophets to ask queſtions of the old, as 1 Cor. 14. v. 29. And as the form and matter handled did alter, ſo alſo the Prophets and teachers did change their names, and were called Doctours,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:123664:156"/> Rabbies, Lawyers, Maſters, Scribes and Wiſe among the Jews. And ſuch were the ſynagogues in the time of Chriſt, which Mr. Gilleſpie is not certain whether he ought to call churches or civil courts: yet he is rather of opinion that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the 30. year of Chriſt, when they had power to judge of capitall matters, they were rather civil courts then churches; but after the 30. year of Chriſt, this judgement of cauſes for life and death being taken from them, then they were to be called churches or eccleſiaſticall aſſemblies. Which is a very frivolous exception as ever was deviſed, and ſheweth the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his cauſe. For is a court more or leſſe civil, becauſe it hath or hath not the judgement of capitall cauſes? By that reaſon moſt courts in England ſhould be eccleſiaſticall, as the court of Exchequer, court Baron, and court Let.</p>
               <p>But the nature of thoſe convocations, ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues or particular churches of the Jews, having been for many hundred years, ſince they were carried firſt into captivity, ſuch, that they were inveſted not only with a faculty to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form duties and acts of worſhip to God, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with a power of magiſtracy; when a great many of them from ſynagogues of the Jewes were after turned into churches of Chriſtians, they retained the ſame conſtitution and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in performing church-duties, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing power of magiſtracy; which ſometimes
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:123664:157"/> was aſſumed by the conſent of the members, ſometimes delegated by the Emperours. For as the Jewes began to be the firſt profeſſours of Chriſtian religion, ſo the firſt churches were ſynagogues of the Jewes converted to Chriſtian religion: but yet before the converſion of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire ſynagogue, thoſe that were Chriſtians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed themſelves for fear of the reſt, and yet did not depart, but when they were perſecuted, or thruſt out of the ſynagogue. So that ſome ſynagogues, for ſome Chriſtians that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, were called churches, as we may ſee if we compare Gal. 1. v. 13. with Act. 22. v. 19: for in one place St. Paul ſaith that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted in every ſynagogue thoſe that profeſſed the name of Chriſt; in the other, that he did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the church. And Act. 18. v. 19. it is like that either the greateſt part, or the whole ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue was a Chriſtian church, though it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſtill the name of a ſynagogue: And no doubt at Antioch the whole ſynagogue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Chriſt, ſince they durſt openly take the name of Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>But the words of Chriſt Iohn 16. v. 2. <hi>they ſhall put you out of the ſynagogue,</hi> ſhew, that ſy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>agogues of the Iewes ſhould become Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian churches, and that thoſe that profeſſed the name of Chriſt, or at leaſt believed in him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly for fear of the Iewes, were not to depart, that by their means the whole ſynagogue might be wonne: and therefore the Lord Ieſus Chriſt
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:123664:157"/> takes this expulſion for an injury done to them in the foregoing verſe, <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken to you, that ye be not offended.</hi> Had not the Lord Ieſus a mind to make of theſe ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues churches, he would have bidden thoſe that were Chriſtians amongſt them to flee from them, and go from them, as he biddes his people flee out of Babylon. And indeed we do not read that Criſpus, chief ruler of the ſynagogue, and other believing Iewes, did forſake the ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue; or that when the whole ſynagogue was converted, it did preſently looſe the name of a ſynagogue, but kept it, as we ſee Iames 2. v. 2. <hi>If there come into the ſynagogue,</hi> and Hebr. 10. v. 22. The very heathens did not put a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for a good while betwixt Iewes &amp; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; for Suetonius ſaith that Claudins <hi>did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the Iewes, who by the impulſion of Chriſt did raiſe tumults.</hi> So that in expelling the Iews, the Chriſtians were comprehended; for it is ſaid Act. 18. v. 2. that Aquila and Priſcilla, though Chriſtians, were commanded to depart from Rome. And as the Chriſtians ſuffered as Iewes, ſo what priviledges they enjoyed, it was a grant unto the Iewes: and as in the 9. of Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius the Iewes, and with them the Chriſtians, were baniſhed; ſo in the firſt year of his Empire the ſame liberty that was granted unto the Iews, did alſo belong to the Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>So then the ſynagogues were the firſt ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine and platform of Chriſtian churches, and
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:123664:158"/> after thoſe ſynagogues the gentils converted did modell their churches, retaining the ſame power of magiſtracy as the ſynagogues had, as Mr. Lightfoot doth very well obſerve; yea in their way of teaching following the Prophets in their ſynagogues, which were alſo ſchools of learning, as namely when they ſpoke by turns, and the younger Prophets ſubmitted to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the elder, 1 Cor. 14. v. 29, 30, &amp;c. Therefore ſince the churches of the Chriſtians were but ſynagogues, changing ſomewhat the doctrine, but not at all the diſcipline, we muſt conceive of all churches and their acts of power as of ſynagogues, and of church-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication as of Jewiſh excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or putting out of the ſynagogue; that of Chriſtians being no more a law or ordinance of Chriſt then that of the Iews was a law and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of Moſes: for neither of them was. For it never came to be in uſe among the Iewes, till they took it up upon the want of their own judges and magiſtrates, by conſent and by a confederate diſcipline, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Chriſtians, imitatours of the Iewes, and who had the law and the covenants, yea the Lord Ieſus Chriſt from them, did alſo take up excommunication upon the ſame grounds as they did. Bullingerus in an Epiſtle to Dathenus an. 1531. tells us, it was thought ſo by Zwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius; <hi>the Apoſtles lived under a heatheniſh magiſtrate, who yet did not puniſh wicked

               <p>It is obſervable, that the holy Apoſtle, when he ſaith, <hi>is it ſo that there is not a wiſe man amongſt you?</hi> &amp;c. and, <hi>ſet them to judge who are least eſteemed,</hi> ſpeaketh ironically, implying that were there no wiſe men amongſt you, ſuch as you muſt appoint, yet the matter they are ſet over is not ſo knotty and hard, but that men the leaſt eſteemed amongſt you, ſo that they were honeſt men, might well underſtand and decide it.</p>
               <p>Reverend Mr. <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> upon the cloſure of the fifth chapter and the beginning of the ſixth of the firſt to the Corinthians, is of opinion that this is the meaning of that place: theſe be his words; <hi>Afterwards to take the Corinthians off from going to infidel judges, he requireth them to decide the matter themſelves, till the

               </p>
               <p>Origen upon the 21. of Exodus Homil. 11. makes it clear that this is the meaning of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, by telling us the practiſe of churches in his time: <hi>Principes populi &amp; presbyteri plebis debent omni hora populum judicarc, ſemper &amp; ſine intermiſſione ſedere in judicio, dirimere lites, reconciliare diſſidentes, in gratiam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordare diſcordes; The heads and elders of the people ought every hour to judge the people, alwayes and without intermiſſion to ſit in judgement, decide controverſies, reconcile thoſe that have differences, and make thoſe friends that are at variance.</hi> Here is magiſtracy aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by church-members, when, by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, elders and wiſe men are appointed to take up ſuch differences in a friendly way, and ſuch controverſies betwixt brother &amp; brother, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe were to be adjudged before ſecular judges.

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:123664:161"/> magiſtracy? Theſe be the words of Anton. de Dominis lib. 5. cap. 2. <hi>without a lay-power we can doe nothing; we cannot by our eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiasticall power put out, take off, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame Origen, in his 1. book againſt Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, ſpeaketh of that magiſtracy aſſumed by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and mutuall agreement, called by him <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>There be ſome appointed to enquire into the manners and wayes of their living who frequent churches; that ſo they may keep thoſe off from coming into their aſſembly, that ſtain their lives by foul and unworthy actions, and admit with all readineſs thoſe that are otherwiſe, and make them daily better.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though by their power of magiſtracy aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by conſent they might put out any one that was already a church-member, yet it ſeemeth it was not the ſettled practiſe in Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens time; but only, as to admit good men, ſo not to receive into their ſociety thoſe that they did not know to be ſuch. No excommunication was then in uſe with him: for as the admitting a good man into church-fellowſhip is no abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, ſo the not receiving a bad man into the church is no excommunication. This is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Juſtin Martyr in his 2. Apologie, where he ſaith, <hi>No man elſe is permitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that aliment called with us the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, but he that believes our doctrine is true, and hath been waſhed by the waſhing for remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:123664:162"/> of ſins.</hi> For there Juſtin ſpeaketh not of church-members; only he ſaith, that heathens and unbaptiſed men are not to partake of the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, or to have any part in thoſe myſteries. Of the cuſtome of excluding church-members, I confeſſe we read in Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian and Cyprian, anſwerable to the Niddui and Cherem of the Jewes.</p>
               <p>Tertullian, in the 2. chapter of his Apologe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, ſpeaketh of the like confederate diſcipline or power of magiſtracy taken up by conſent; and in the 39. chapter he maketh an enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the parts of that diſcipline.</p>
               <p>I ſhould now have done with Origen, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending next to alledge Ambroſe confirming what Origen ſaith concerning the practiſe of the church, agreeable to the counſell and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of St. Paul; only I will take notice farther from Origen, of the face of the church in his time, and of the power aſſumed then by the Chriſtians. Celſus, a great Philoſopher, and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the Chriſtians, did accuſe them that they had a diſcipline quite different from the lawes of the Romans, that they kept private conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and there had a particular ſecret covenant, law and diſcipline, no leſſe repugnant to the lawes of the Emperour, then if they had been in open rebellion. And indeed even among the Grecians theſe private meetings were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times forbidden, although the ſtate were nothing concerned in them, they being to no other end
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:123664:162"/> but to perform ſome religious ſervice. For Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius Nepos, that Alcibiades, was condemned to dye for performing ſome religious worſhip, it may be ſacrifice at his own houſe. Origen an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth, by alledging an example very fit to our purpoſe, and applyable to the nature of the power that Chriſtians and private churches do exerciſe under a perſecuting magiſtrate. He bringeth an example of a ſtranger living among the Scythians, who muſt either conform himſelf to the ungodly lawes of that nation, or be a law unto himſelf. This ſame ſtranger, ſaith Origen, cannot be ſaid to violate the lawes of the Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, if he doth not worſhip Statues, but doth privately worſhip the true God, and in a right manner, and if he be a law unto himſelf. This is the caſe about the nature of the power exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by churches, and an anſwer to that ſo much urged objection, that the Chriſtian churches have been long without a magiſtrate, therefore governed by a power diſtinct from that of the magiſtrate. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. Origen implyeth, that if the lawes of the Scythians had been good and tolerable, that then this ſtranger had been obliged to obey them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The lawes of the magiſtrate being ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this ſtranger living in his dominion muſt do his beſt, that he, his family and adherents be a law and a magiſtrate unto themſelves, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form by a dictate of conſcience what the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:123664:163"/> was to enjoin and command. Here none will ſay, that this ſtranger, living among the Scythians, governeth himſelf by a power di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from that of the magiſtrate: for ſo Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers and Mathematicians, who were often forbidden in Rome, and baniſhed, yet lurking in corners, and having private conventicles, might likewiſe be ſaid to be governed by a power Philoſophicall &amp; Mathematicall, diſtinct from that of the magiſtrate; and a ſonne, to whom God hath given the grace not to hearken to a bad father, muſt not be ſaid to govern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by a power diſtinct from the paternall, for indeed ſuch a ſon is a father to himſelf. The like may we ſay of private churches under a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting magiſtrate, who are fain to ſettle a magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy by conſent of all the members of the churches; as the ſynagogues were faign to be uſed when they lived under a magiſtrate that was not of their own nation and religion: then they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by a confederate diſcipline, what the magiſtrate was to enjoin and command them. The confeſſion of Baſilartic. 6. hath a notable ſaying, ſpeaking of the duty of magiſtrates to propagate the Goſpell as they are magiſtrates: <hi>This duty was enjoyned a magiſtrate of the gentils; how much more ought it to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the Chriſtian magistrate, being the Vicar of God?</hi> If then the heathen magiſtrate fails of his duty, in not propagating the Goſpell, thoſe that live under him, and are better minded,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:123664:163"/> ought to ſupply the part of the magiſtrate in that particular; and yet in doing of that they do but perform their own duty and buſineſſe: like as a maſter leading his horſe down the hill, his man being out of the way, doeth both his own buſineſſe and that of his man, and both em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployeth his own ſtrength in guiding an unruly horſe, and ſupplieth that of his man: or (which expreſſeth more lively the thing in hand) as the Duke of Somerſet, in training up Prince Edward in the true religion, did both do his own duty and that of Henry the 8. his father; who being wanting to his duty in ſhewing his power &amp; authority to have his ſon brought up in the true Proteſtant religion, Somerſet, Cranmer and others were not to be wanting to theirs; and yet were not to act by a power di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the power of the King: for if ſo, then when ever a power is exerciſed rightly, and yet againſt an unlawfull command of a ſuperiour, we had need to give a new name to that power, and there would be as many kinds of power, as duties to be performed.</p>
               <p>Having done with Origen, I come to Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, whom I was to alledge upon the 1. of Timothy, relating to the places of St. Paul and Origen, and to the power of magiſtracy aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by churches. There he teacheth the cuſtom both of the ſynagogues &amp; of Chriſtian churches, of having elders that compoſed, in ſtead of the magiſtrate, controverſies ariſing amongſt
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:123664:164"/> church-members; ſaying that firſt ſynagogues, and afterwards churches had elders, without whoſe advice there was nothing done in the church; and wondreth that in his time, which was about the year 370, ſuch men were out of uſe: which he thinks came by the negligence, or rather pride of ſome Doctors, who thought it was beneath them to be eſteemed the leſſe in the church, as S. Paul ſaith of them, while they are to decide controverſies, not as judges inveſted with a coercive power, but only as arbitrators and umpires.</p>
               <p>But the true cauſe why theſe elders ceaſed, which he wiſheth had been ſtill continued, he mentioneth not: but the true cauſe is, when the magiſtrate, that was for above 300. years hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh, became Chriſtian, theſe arbitrators and elders ceaſed in great part, at leaſt they were more out of churches then in churches, and in ſtead of them the Emperours created judges, which yet retained much of the nature of thoſe whereof Origen and Ambroſe ſpeak, and which were inveſted (as moſt of the Lawyers affirm, as Cujacius for one, &amp; with them my Rev. Father, in his book <hi>de Monarchia temporal,</hi> and in his <hi>Hyperaſpiſtes lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 15.) not with a coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive juriſdiction, but, as they term it, audience: hence comes the Biſhops and Deanes and Chapters Audit. However ſuch arbitrators ſate in a court, and were choſen by the Chriſtian Emperours, and were not members, as before,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:123664:164"/> ever ſince St. Pauls time, choſen by the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of that church where the contention did ariſe betwixt brother and brother: and at that time it was not thought a violation of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of St. Paul, if a wronged brother had gone to ſecular judges, becauſe they were not infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, but Chriſtians, faithfull, and ſaints, as the Apoſtle termeth them, 1 Cor. 6. 2. therefore it was free for any lay-man or other, either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to the Audit of the Biſhop, or to the ſecular judge. Which cuſtome Ambroſe doth not like ſo well, as when Jewes and Chriſtians were obliged by the law of their diſcipline to have controverſies decided by their own elders. Certain it is that theſe elders, (though they were not, as Ambroſe wiſht they had been, in his time arbitrators in thoſe churches whereof they were members) kept that office a long time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſtian Emperours, but with more autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and dignity, becauſe they were countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Emperours their maſters. We have them mentioned pretty late, even in Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, Honorius and Arcadius time: for in one law they enjoin that ordinary judges ſhould decide the contentions between Jewes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils, not their own elders or arbitrators. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it is worth conſidering, that that title which in the Theodoſian Code is <hi>de Epiſcopali audien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> in the Juſtinian Code is <hi>de Epiſcopali judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio:</hi> a main proof, that theſe judgements in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopall courts had much ſtill of the nature of
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:123664:165"/> thoſe references in churches under the heathen Emperours.</p>
               <p>Theſe epiſcopall courts were ſet up by the Emperours, to favour the clergy, that they might be judged <hi>in prima inſtantia</hi> by their own judges: for if either party had not ſtood to the ſentence of that court, they might appeal to the ſecular court. The words of the 28. Canon of the councell of Chalcedon are very expreſſe: <hi>If a clerk hath a matter againſt a clerk, let him not leave his Biſhop, and appeal to ſecular judgement, but let the cauſe firſt be judged by his own Biſhop.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this epiſcopall court being in ſubſtance the ſame power with that of the elders men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by Ambroſe, which were firſt in ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, and then in Chriſtian churches under the heathen Emperours, one may plainly ſee how weak and ſandy the grounds are upon which eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction, and the power of the keyes, and of binding and looſing, in the hands of church-officers is built; which govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſay they, is the government of Chriſt, and is to be managed by thoſe church-officers by a warrant from Chriſt the mediatour. For Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine erecting an epiſcopall court, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering the judges of the court to decide cauſes and controverſies, did not intend to give them a commiſſion of binding and looſing, or to put into their hands the keyes of Heaven, ſo dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating a power which was none of his to give;
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:123664:165"/> but only granted what was in his own power, namely, that ſome magiſtrates under him ſhould ſet all things in order in the church, and among the clergy. Beſides, he intended to ſet up that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, which was through the neceſſity of the times aſſumed firſt by ſynagogues, then by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian churches under perſecution: for ſure Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine did not place the power of the keyes &amp; of binding and looſing in the exerciſe of that power managed either by the elders, which Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe mentioneth, or by the epiſcopall court erected by himſelf. Neither Conſtantine nor any of his ſucceſſours did ever conceive, that churches were to be governed by any other power then their own, as all other ſocieties of men were.</p>
               <p>In this epiſcopall court any cauſe between man and man, clergy-man or not, was decided; capitall only excepted. For matters of faith, I confeſſe there be many Emperours ſanctions, forbidding ſecular courts to meddle with them: but this doth not argue that the clergy had any power more then declarative, not ſancitive. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. This very ſanction, that ſecular courts ſhould not meddle with matters of faith, was a law of the Emperour, and the epiſcopall courts or ſynods could not challenge any power therein, but by a commiſſion from the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Emperours did not conceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:123664:166"/> obliged to receive lawes concerning faith from the Biſhops, or that coming from them they had a ſtamp of authority through all the Emperours dominions, except they were approved of and ratified by them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Emperours did not think themſelves much obliged to receive lawes of doctrine and faith from the Biſhops, in regard that moſt of the lawes and conſtitutio is concerning the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall points of faith were compoſed, reduced and inſerted into the Code, without ſo much as taking counſell or advice of the Biſhops; though we never read that they ever complained thereof. Only a late famous Lawyer and a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt, in his book <hi>de Iuſtinianei ſeculi moribus cap.</hi> 2. maketh a great complaint thereof; which is a ſtrong argument that the magiſtrate did not then acknowledge any eccleſiaſticall power ſeated in the clergy.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And the power that the Emperours chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged to belong ſolely to them, to call ſynods, to chuſe members, to review their acts, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, ratifie, diſannull, or give them the vigour and ſtrength of lawes obliging all churches and men to obedience, either active or paſſive, is an argument, that what ever combined churches under the heathen Emperours did, in calling of ſynods, making lawes and decrees, and requiring from all churches and church-members obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to them; the Emperours did not conceive otherwiſe of thoſe acts of theirs, but as of acts
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:123664:166"/> of magiſtracy taken up by conſent, for want of a Chriſtian magiſtrate, and which was to laſt no longer then till the time that God ſhould ſend a Chriſtian magiſtrate. For had not theſe been the thoughts both of the Emperours and the Biſhops at that time, how came it that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine the Great, &amp; the other Chriſtian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours that came after him, did not rather wiſh the Biſhops &amp; clergy to call ſynods upon their own authority, as they were wont to do? and how came it that O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ius, Spiridion, &amp; Paphnutius did not diſſwade Conſtantine from taking upon him to call ſynods, telling him that it was more then did belong to him, and ſpeak in the language of Mr. Gilleſpie, that miniſters by virtue of their office are to call and aſſemble ſynods; that it is altogether unreaſonable that they ſhould be abridged of what they had enjoyed for 300. years, and now looſe a main branch of their eccleſiaſticall power; that hitherto it was not ſo much as thought on, that magiſtracy, which is not a thing eſſentiall to the church, ſhould ſo far entrench upon the government of Chriſt, wherewith the miniſters are ſolely entruſted? But theſe notions came not into the minds either of the Emperours, or of Oſius, Euſtatius, Paph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutius and others, nor of Hierom, who que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned the validity of a ſynod that was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocated by the Emperour. Theſe good men did not quarrell either at the convocation of ſynods, or at the making or giving of lawes to churches
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:123664:167"/> by the ſole authority of the Emperours.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A further proof that neither the Emperours, nor the Kings after the Roman Empire was broken in pieces, conceived that Biſhops and clergy-men had any judiciall power diſtinct from theirs, is, that for many 100. years in moſt parts of the Roman Empire, as it then was, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours and Kings kept ſtate-aſſemblies, where both clergy and laity ſate and voted, without any ſuch diſtinction of power eccleſiaſticall and civil.</p>
               <p>I ſhould here ſhew, as I promiſed in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the chapter, that the very heathens never knew any ſuch diſtinction of power: for although the law of nature and nations taught them, that there muſt be a ſacred function diſtinct from others, yet they never knew nor underſtood that the juriſdiction of that function was diſtinct from that of the others: for many thouſand years neither the people of God nor the heathens knew any ſuch diſtinction. Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle in the third of his politicks ch. 10. ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of heroick Kings, <hi>the Kings,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>were judges and moderators in all divine matters.</hi> So was the Roman Senat, both before and after it was governed by Emperours; for it was wont to conſecrate Emperours; and the name of <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifex Maximus,</hi> of which they were ſo jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, was taken by the Emperours even till Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians time. In ſhort, they alwayes conceived that a common magiſtracy and ſoveraign power was
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:123664:167"/> made up of theſe two main ingredients, <hi>viz.</hi> ceremonies about religion and humane lawes, both put in truſt with the ſoveraign magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>One thing I cannot but obſerve: that the very heathens by the light of nature have gone here beyond Mr. Gilleſpie. For, to confirm a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon errour, that the church juriſdiction is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly independent from the magiſtrate, and that the end of magiſtracy is only the protection of temporall life, having nothing to do with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the eternall good of the ſoul, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, I ſay, this errour, he teacheth us that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy is not ſubſervient to the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt the Mediatour <hi>ex natura rei.</hi> But this errour is refuted by the very heathen, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ariſtotle, in his 3. book of Politicks ch. 16. where he ſaith, that the ſcope of politicks is not ſimply to live, but to live well. I ſhould ask Mr. Gilleſpie, when a magiſtrate turneth from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſm to Chriſtianity, whether his firſt duty is not to ſeek the Kingdom of Heaven, both for himſelf and all that are under his charge.</p>
               <p>There is alſo a notable paſſage of Pareus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his <hi>Miſcellanea Catechetica, artic.</hi> 11. <hi>aphoriſ.</hi> 18. where he lamenteth that heathens ſhould ſurpaſſe Chriſtians in this particular, in attributing more to the magiſtrate for ordering matters of religion, and that they in this point ſhould be more orthodox: theſe be his words; <hi>Ac ſane dolendum eſt, rectius in hoc capite ſenſiſſe olim ethnicos, qui unanimi conſenſu

               </p>
               <p>As pregnant a proof, that the ſame perſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the heathens had the managing of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious as well as civil affairs, is that of Cicero, in his Oration <hi>pro domo ſua ad Pontifices:</hi> the words are theſe; <hi>Praeclare à majoribus noſtris conſtitutum eſt, quod vos eoſdem &amp; religionibus Deorum immortalium &amp; ſummae reipublicae praeeſſe voluerunt; ut ampliſſimi &amp; clariſſimi cives rempublicam bene gerendo, religioſiſſimi religiones ſapienter interpretando, rempubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam conſervarent. It was excellently well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by our anceſtours, that the ſame perſons ſhould be put in care with matters of religion, and the ſupreme government of ſtate: that ſo, whilſt the moſt noble and renowned citizens ſhould ſee to the right ordering of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and the most religious to the right in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting of religious matters, the frame of the Commonwealth might be preſerved and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured.</hi>

                  <p>That eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction as it is held by the Romiſh church, better agreeth with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and the letter of the Scripture then that of the presbyterian brethren.

               <p>THat eccleſiaſticall power of depoſing, excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating, and making lawes authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, as it is aſſumed by the Pope and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh clergy, is not only more conſonant to reaſon, and the literall ſenſe of the Scripture, but alſo very agreeable with their corrupt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in doctrine and practiſe: whereas quite contrary, the eccleſiaſticall power with all its appurtenances as it is aſſumed and held by the preſbyterians, is altogether diſſonant from the holineſſe of their life and doctrine, and is more repugnant to reaſon &amp; the letter of the Scripture.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Neither the papiſts nor the presbyterians have any expreſſe place of Scripture for a double juriſdiction, except they both make uſe of that of St. Luc. 22. v. 38. alledged by Bonifacius the 8. <hi>behold, here are two ſwords.</hi>
               </p>

                  </gap>trates juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:123664:169"/> yet <hi>de facto</hi> they make of two but one, in that they ſubordinate the temporall juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the ſpirituall, conceiving it altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient to conſtitute two coordinate powers, ſince one muſt be ſupreme, and the ſupreme muſt include the inferiour; and that the end of the temporall being ſubordinate to the end of the ſpirituall, thoſe that have the managing of the temporall juriſdiction muſt likewiſe be ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and ſubject to the ſpirituall juriſdiction. Theſe are the arguments of Bonifacius and Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin; and upon theſe grounds all ſtates and magiſtrates, being but miniſters of God in mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the temporall power, muſt be obedient to all acts and ſentences of the ſpirituall juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which the miniſters of God in the Goſpell are entruſted with: ſo that the magiſtrates power being ſubordinate to the eccleſiaſticall, all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals from civil judicatories muſt be valid, and ſo all ſentences of excommunications of what perſons ſoever. But the ſame eccleſiaſticall power, as it is challenged by the presbyterians to be coordinate to the power of the magiſtrate, rendreth all acts of excommunication alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unreaſonable and unwarrantable.</p>
               <p>For it is but reaſonable that a man ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to a power that is either ſubordinate to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or that hath no ſupreme or collateral: but it would trouble one to be ſentenced by a power that is neither ſoveraign nor ſubordinate, as is the eccleſiaſticall. Neither is it leſſe unreaſonable,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:123664:169"/> that the ſame man, ſubject both to the eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall and the civil power, being condemned by one of the powers, cannot ſo much as ſeek for remedy in the court of that power that ought to give him defence and protection. The Pope well foreſaw he could not depoſe a King, except the power of the King were ſubordinate to that of the Pope. But Zanchius and ſome others though they do not make the temporall power ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the ſpirituall, yet they hold that Kings and magiſtrates are no leſſe ſubject to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of excommunication then the meaneſt member of a church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The denoſing of a King or other magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate is a reſult <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> flowing from excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication: for if by excommunication a man is made a member of Satan, whoſe addreſſe, converſation &amp; company is to be avoided by all good men, it comes much to one paſs either to depoſe him, or to put him into ſuch a condition, in which he hath but the name of a King, which is done by excommunication. And therefore <hi>Emanuel Sa</hi> well expreſſeth the ſenſe of the Romaniſts, and with it the true conſequence of excommunication; which indeed, if there be ſuch a thing, muſt be as he defines it, aphoriſ <hi>verbo excommunicationis: An excommunicated perſon is ſuſpended from his office and benefice, and cannot judge, accuſe or witneſſe, §.</hi> 27. But that excommunication held by presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, by which Kings excommunicated may
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:123664:170"/> ſtill retain their authority and power as before, is altogether inconſiſtent with reaſon. Can a man delivered to Satan make lawes obliging for conſcience ſake? Can a ſoveraign put to ſhame and confuſion, yea execration, by a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of excommunication, be truſted by his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects? or can a ſubject excommunicated and rejected by ſuch a ſolemn act, as unworthy to have any communion with Chriſtians, be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted by his ſoveraign with the managing of the great affairs of ſtate, by which union &amp; communion is maintained among all ranks of people?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Excommunication is very agreeable with the headſhip of the Pope under Chriſt in the government of the Catholick church; for he doth but expell a man out of the pale that bounds his juriſdiction. But a miniſter or a preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery excommunicating either a King or any other man, cannot ſay that their excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion extendeth as far as the bounds of their juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, ſince they have not yet defined how far it extendeth: ſurely, not ſo far as, and no further then the juriſdiction of the magiſtrate under which they live: for the eccleſiaſticall and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall juriſdiction is not limited by mens bounds; for it is like the place of the Angels; one may ſay they are here, but one cannot ſay that they are not there.

Beſides, it doth very well ſtand to reaſon, (what the Romaniſts would have) that one body of a church ſhould have one governour, and one government, which is that of Chriſt: but ſo doth it not, that the presbyterian govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be the government of Chriſt, and yet not be received by all the members of the church of Chriſt; as they cannot deny but that there are many churches, which yet do not hold presbytery to be the government of Chriſt.</p>

This the Papiſts as they hold, ſo they practiſe: for they make the magiſtrate but ſubſervient to the care that the Pope is to take in governing the church, yielding to his judgement and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and executing his decrees and buls with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controul.

So that if each party conceiveth that the care of the church doth not belong chiefly to the other, but that he is to look to it as he thinks
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:123664:171"/> fitting, and not to truſt the main care with any one but himſelf, I fear we ſhall need a third par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to take care that theſe two may care but for one thing.</p>

But the giving this great power of the keyes of Heaven, and of binding and looſing, expreſſed in very high and emphaticall terms, cannot be applyable to a presbyterian church, againſt which the gares of hell ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail; nor can it ſtand with the little <hi>modulus</hi> of power of a presbytery, which yet hath found no legs to walk on; they not reſolving us yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the paſtor, or the people, or both muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, that the ſentence of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication may be valid, nor how farre it reacheth.</p>

Particularly, that ſaying of the Papiſts, that there cannot be a greater argument that their judgements are infallible then this, that God ratifieth them in Heaven, is much accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the literall arguing of the Scripture, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that <hi>whatſoever ſhall be bound,</hi> &amp;c. that is,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:123664:172"/> as they interpret it, whatſoever ſhall be decreed by them and paſſed on earth, ſhall afterwards be ratified and approved in Heaven. For were their judgements fallible, then God would not have tyed himſelf by his promiſe to approve of all the erroneous judgements of men, which they ſay cannot be ſaid without blaſphemy. But the fallibility of the judgements of presbyterian ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories is repugnant to the letter of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which promiſeth to ratify all the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are paſſed by men on earth.</p>
               <p n="10">10. So for the power of the Pope in abſolving and looſing men from their oaths and promiſes, and fidelity due to their ſoveraign, it doth very well agree with the letter of the Scripture, <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ye ſhall looſe on earth ſhall be looſed in heaven,</hi> for here is a power given without any modification.

               <p n="11">11. Laſtly, the juriſdiction held by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts is a true &amp; valid juriſdiction, for it is coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive, and extendeth to the body, eſtate, liberty and good name; the Pope and Biſhops have their priſons: but the presbyterian is a name without a thing; for they are loth to call it coercive; it muſt be then perſwaſive.

               <p n="1">1. That for four thouſand years no ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication was in uſe, either among the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens or the Jewes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That at that time when ſome think it had a beginning, even when the Jewes were carried into captivity, it did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That there is no ground for ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:123664:176"/> communication nor practiſe in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That ſoon after Chriſt and the Apoſtles time excommunication begun, and was mainly ſubſervient to the working of the myſtery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Excommunication being retained by the reformers, did occaſionally ſtrengthen the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of iniquity.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, it is eaſy to ſhew that there was no ſuch excommunication among the heathens as we have deſcribed. It is true, that many learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Grammarians and Lawyers, as Polydore Virgil, Tiraquellus, Fortatulus and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, hold that excommunication was in uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the heathens before it was practiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jewes: but it had nothing of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication agreed on by all parties. The example of Alcibiades, condemned for keeping holy conventicies in Cornelius Nepos, doth not concern excommunication, ſince it was a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall act of the people of Athens: neither was that an excommunication whereof Caeſar ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his Commentaries, being a forinſecall ſentence pronounced by the Druides, who were judges of the land, and medled with any ſuch kind of matters as are uſually judged at Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter Hall in term time: for there was not then any diviſion of power. Draco, ſaith De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes, amongſt other penalties impoſed, ranketh excluſion from courts, pleading, temples,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:123664:176"/> and performing their idol-worſhip. Dionyſius Halicarnaſſeus in the year from the building of Rome 254 ſaith, that the Senat made a decree to expiate all thoſe that in the civil wars were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to ſhed blood. And Diodorus Siculus hath a notable example <hi>lib.</hi> 16. <hi>ſect.</hi> 23. that though amongſt all the nations in Greece there were variety of functions, yet there was an iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of juriſdiction: for the Council of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicty ones did proceed againſt the violators and plunderers of Temples and Altars, &amp; made lawes concerning their publick worſhip. Alſo Lampridius telleth us, that Alexander the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour reviewed the ſentences of the colledge of Augurs: alſo Tertullian in his Apologetick <hi>cap.</hi> 5. ſaith, that it was the prerogative of the ſenate to conſecrate their Gods, and to order the religion that was to be obſerved among the people.</p>
               <p>Let us now come to the Jewes; and firſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what they have to ſhew for excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before the law was given. Beza and others make excommunication as ancient as the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: they ſay, God did excommunicate Adam and Cain. Others would have thoſe Angels who did not perſiſt in their integrity to have been thruſt out of Heaven by excommunication. But theſe acts being judiciall acts of God, not as Paſtor of his church, but as loveraign judge, cannot ſerve the turn: beſides that excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation ſuppoſeth a poſſibility of abſolution, and
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:123664:177"/> returning to the former condition; and ſuch could not the excommunication of the bad An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels be, nor that of Adam, who was never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Paradiſe.</p>
               <p>Since the Law, they alledge for excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>cerith</hi> or cutting off; which Mr. Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furd confeſſeth was done by death or otherwiſe, and ſo can be no plea for excommunication: beſides that it was inflicted by the magiſtrate, and was a corporall puniſhment, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth nothing for presbyterian excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>Zanchius, in an Epiſtle to Frederick the III. Prince Palatine, ſaith, that Marie the ſiſter of Moſes was excommunicated being put out of the camp. But was the camp any more a part of the church then of the commonwealth? or why was this act of exculſion rather an eccleſiaſticall act then a civil? And was this penalty inflicted upon Mary by the Prieſts and Levites ſitting in a judicatory diſtinct from that of Moſes?</p>
               <p>No great ſtreſſe or ſtrength is there for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication in the judgement that befell Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah, Dathan and Abiram: for this example rather teacheth us, that the nature of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication ſtands not in an expelling or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving any one from us by a judiciall ſentence, but rather in excommunicating and withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves from the communion of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for ſo are the words Numbers 16. <hi>Separate your ſelves from among that congregation, and
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:123664:177"/> bid all the people to depart from the tents of theſe wicked men.</hi> Such excommunication I ſhall willingly grant, whereby we may avoid and reject hereticks and hereſies; flee from the devil, but not put the devil to flight by excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication. The beſt way to eſchew the unfruitfull works and workers of darkneſſe, and to have no communion with them, is to withdraw from their communion.</p>
               <p>They urge much legall uncleanneſſe, for which they ſay men were ſeparated from the reſt of the congregation. This, Mr. Rutherfurd ſaith p. 285. was a ceremoniall excommunication; thereby ſilently confeſſing that reall excommunication was not in uſe, till all the ceremonies were taken away. Suppoſe that the legall uncleanneſſe had been a type of the morall, it could not be a type of a thing then preſent, but of a future: but we have proved that the legall cleanneſſe was a type of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, &amp; the legall unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe a type of thoſe that being not clad with Chriſts righteouſneſs, were ſeparated from Chriſt and his elect, as the goats are from the ſheep. A perfect righteouſneſs, ſuch as was the legall, cannot be a type of the morall righteouſneſſe, which is imperfect: and the want of legall clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doth very well prefigure the want of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, but it doth not ſo well ſhadow out the want of morall righteouſneſſe, which doth not as ſuch ſeparate men from Chriſt. Since then, as Mr. Rutherfurd confeſſeth,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:123664:178"/> this ſeparation of lepers and ſuch as were pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with legall uncleanneſſe was but a cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall excommunication, I long to hear from him but one only example in all the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a reall excommunication, which was typified by the ceremoniall excommunication, or that ever any man was kept from the paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or the ſacrifices for a morall uncleanneſſe: which he will never be able to ſhew. Beſides, this ſequeſtring or ſeparating of a leprous or legally unclean perſon was no judiciall act of the Prieſts and Levites, more then of the elders of the people; and ſo by that, excommunication ſhould not be a ſentence agreeing with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription we have given of it, and which is agreed on by all ſides that plead for excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.</p>
               <p>It is obſervable, that not all the Levites, but only Aaron and his ſons could judge of the leper, therein prefiguring Chriſt, who only knoweth his own, and diſcerneth his elect from others, and the ſheep from the goats: ſo that this legall rite cannot be applyed to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, which they ſay is a judiciall act that may be performed by every miniſter of the Goſpell. And therefore the Papiſts have very good reaſon on their ſide, who being not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to looſe their power of excommunicating, nor to forgo the uſuall plea taken from the Prieſts judging of the leper, ſaw, that ſince only Aaron &amp; his ſons were inveſted with the power
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:123664:178"/> of judging the leper, it was therefore fitting that the power of excommunication, prefigured by that power of diſcerning leproſie, ſhould belong only to the Biſhops, who ſucceed the ſons of Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, and are in the Chriſtian church what the ſons of Aaron were in the Jewiſh. Now I have ſhewed elſewhere, that Goſpell-Prophets or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters did not ſucceed the Prieſts or Levites, but the Prophets of the old Teſtament, who had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with judging of the leproſy: and that therefore the Prieſts judging of the leproſy apart from other men, is no plea either for excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication or for eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that the Prieſts did judge of the leproſy not ſo much by their office, as by the skill annexed to their office; and ſo they did but as phyſitians, who are beſt able to judge of the peſtilence, yet are only to give their judgement, but not to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate any one from the reſt of men by their juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, no more then the Prieſts did.</p>

               <p>SOme are of opinion that excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had its beginning in Ezra's (chap. 7. v. 27.) and Nehemiahs times, Nehem. 10. v. 29. and ch. 13. v. 25. where Aben Ezra expoundeth <hi>I curſed them,</hi> of the two kinds of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>Niddui</hi> and <hi>Cherem:</hi> though others que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion it, and ſay that theſe three kinds of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, <hi>Niddui, Cherem</hi> and <hi>Scha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>natha,</hi> were not invented of two hundred years after. However it is certain, as ſome Rabbins obſerve, that in the time of Ezra and Nehemiah ſomething like excommunication begun; for the people being led captive, and wanting their wonted magiſtrate, and uſuall legall proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and having no power within themſelves to keep up their religion without mixing with the heathen, or to reſtrain thoſe that would run after Idols; the beſt-minded people, yea moſt of the nation who as yet had not conſulted with themſelves how far they were to perſevere in the religion they were born and brought up in, did body themſelves into ſeverall ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, where they bound themſelves mutually by a ſacred oath (ſome ſay they broke bread upon it) to keep the law of Moſes, and not to join themſelves by marriages to the heathens, and to hold cloſe to the cuſtoms and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of their elders and anceſtours, even of thoſe that were the keepers of ſuch a confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate diſcipline, and were to ſee all things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:123664:179"/> according to oath or covenant, and to take order that whoſoever did break it ſhould ſuffer the penalty impoſed by the diſcipline.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſynagogues ſupplyed the defect both of magiſtracy, and of all thoſe godly meetings which were kept every ſabbath-day in the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Prophets: for in them not only the law of Moſes was read and expounded, and prayers made; but alſo all thoſe cauſes and matters which uſually were handled and determined in higher and lower courts or Sanedrims, were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged, ſo far as the Princes under whom they lived gave them liberty, and enlarged or ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their priviledges: for ſometimes they were not permitted to put any man to death; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they were allowed, even out of Judea, to have their <hi>Ethnarcha</hi> or Prince of the people, who did not ſo much govern the countrey as the nation. Hence we are ſatisfied how the chief Prieſts came to give Paul power to lay hold on the Jewes living out of Judea, and bring them captive to Jeruſalem, for they could not have given ſuch a commiſſion to apprehend a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile.</p>
               <p>Amongſt other penalties that the ſeverall ſynagogues, diſperſed in Judea, Aegypt, Greece, Pontus and Galatia, inflicted, caſting out of the ſynagogue was one. The Rabbins ſay, for the Scripture is ſilent in it, that this caſting out comprehended many degrees of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo that when they were permitted to put
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:123664:180"/> to death, to be put in <hi>Cherem</hi> was thought as much as to dye. But what ever were the degrees or ſpecies of excommunication, and by what title ſo ever called and diſtinguiſhed among the Jewes, it is certain that none of theſe cenſures inflicted by the ſynagogues, or by the keepers of their liberties, were of the nature of the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication we have deſcribed in the precedent chapter. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. Theſe ſynagogues were a mixt aſſembly of men, betwixt a corporation and a church, and had not within their body a juriſdiction of Prieſts and Levites diſtinct from the reſt of the ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, for the high Prieſt was a long time the chief magiſtrate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There being other cenſures inflicted beſides caſting out of the ſynagogue, (which they make excommunication) as ſtoning, burning, whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, cutting of limmes, as learned Mr. <hi>Deſpagne</hi> tells us in his judicious piece of the Harmony of times; there is no reaſon at all to make one cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure more eccleſiaſticall then any of the reſt, as if caſting out was a cenſure inflicted by church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and whipping and cutting of limmes were civil cenſures inflicted by others. Sure a magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, by the ſame power that he cauſeth a cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purſe to be whipt, alſo baniſheth a ſeditious man: ſo were all penalties in thoſe ſynagogues acts of the ſame power and the ſame men, and equally uſing force upon the body; for as yet they knew no ſuch diſtinction of powers and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:123664:180"/> nor were the diſtinctions of eccleſiaſticall and civil, ſpirituall and temporall, found out.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thoſe that were caſt out of the ſynagogue, were alike reſtrained from church and from Commonwealth-priviledges; the church and the Commonwealth being not yet taken for two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct bodies.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We do not read that thoſe that were put out of the ſynagogue were kept off from the Temple, and from being partakers of the ſame myſteries that others not put out of the ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue enjoyed: which ſheweth that excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication was not anſwerable to <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or caſting out of the ſynagogue; for thoſe that in the ſynagogue had power to put one out of it, had not power to bar him either from killing the paſſeover in the temple, or from eating of it at his own home, or from being partaker of all other ſacrifices and ceremonies in the Temple. Chriſt and his Apoſtles taught daily in the Temple, though excommunicated and put out of the Jewes ſynagogues.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Neither do we find to the contrary, but that a man put out of one ſynagogue might in the ſame town or countrey be entertained by another ſynagogue: for Gemara Babvionica ſaith, that he that was excommunicated in one town, was not thought excommunicated in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Many Rabbins ſay, that one private man
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:123664:181"/> uſed to excommunicate and abſolve another: and hereupon ſome are ready to ſay, that Jeſus Chriſt related to that Matth. 18. when he ſaid, <hi>Let him be to thee,</hi> &amp;c. as if he had ſaid, Since he will not hearken to thy good advice, nor that of two or three, nor yet to the church, thy laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge is to excommunicate him in thy private name, and as to thy ſelf only, having nothing farther to do with him. And in that manner will they have the 40. men, who had conſpired to kill Paul, to have excommunicated one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, in caſe any one had been ſlack in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe.</p>
               <p>Now let us ſee what plea there is for excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication in the new Teſtament. We have ſhewed, that the Chriſtians ſucceeding the Jewes, retained by the ſame confederation of diſcipline, under a magiſtrate no friend to them, the ſame power of magiſtracy as they, though not in that high meaſure of juriſdiction; becauſe the Chriſtians were alwayes more perſecuted, and never had ſo large priviledges and liberties granted them as the Jewes had: but yet as little as they had, they could do that which every ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, though never ſo much kept under and in awe, can, <hi>viz.</hi> expell any member of their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, without giving an account of what they do herein to the magiſtrate. And upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count might the Corinthians very well expell the inceſtuous perſon: which act ſhould I hold to have been of the ſame nature with caſting
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:123664:181"/> out of the ſynagogue, I ſee not how any of my oppoſites could alledge any thing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>But I believe the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles had no need to have recourſe to that power of magiſtracy like that of the ſynagogues, aſſumed by confederation of diſcipline: For</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the firſt preaching of the Goſpell there was leſſe need of diſcipline, becauſe the number of paſtors was greater then of church-members; the great work of the miniſtery being laid upon every man, and women converted were to ſtrive to convert others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Apoſtles and the diſciples, as Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, Titus and others, who were looked upon as ſecundary Apoſtles, being conceived to be led by an infallible ſpirit, the people in all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies ariſing needed not go far to be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or take much time in diſcuſſing of them by overſeers or elders ſet a part for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The gift of miracles, ſtriking a terrour, ſupplied the place of a diſcipline: therefore Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer on the 16. of Matth. giveth us this reaſon, why no externall power and juriſdiction was uſed in the time of Chriſt, which ſerves alſo for the time of the Apoſtles: theſe be his words; <hi>No commonwealth can be governed without inflicting puniſhment upon the wicked. What was wanting to the church in externall power, the Lord Ieſus did ſupply it by a miraculous

               <p>But that extraordinary way of ſtriking ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour into new converts by the power of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles ceaſing, Chriſtians being grown numerous, and confirmed in the knowledge of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, it was now convenient they ſhould ſettle churches, which they did, following the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Jewes under a magiſtrate of a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry religion: for indeed at firſt Chriſtian aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies were but ſynagogues turned into churches; ſo that they needed not to look out for other manner of power and diſcipline then that which was exerciſed by the Jewiſh ſynagogues. Were it granted that excommunication is to be proved by thoſe words Matth. 18. <hi>tell it unto the church,</hi> or by the example of the inceſtuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon put out of the church of Corinth, or by the eleventh chapter of the ſame Epiſtle; yet this act of excluſion could not be made good, not to be ſuch an act of magiſtracy aſſumed by confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate diſcipline, as was the caſting out of the ſynagogue.</p>
               <p>Beza, in his preface to his book againſt Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus, alledgeth the opinion of Muſculus and Bullinger to be the ſame with what we now ſpeak of: that the firſt Chriſtians wanting the power of magiſtracy to reſtrain them that walked diſorderly and wickedly, aſſumed ſuch a power of magiſtracy to themſelves, and deviſed
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:123664:182"/> excommunication; and that if there had been a power of magiſtracy in Corinth to puniſh the inceſtuous perſon, there had then been no need either of excommunication, or of delivering the man to Satan. And ſo far we allow excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, as it is an act of magiſtracy aſſumed by a confederate diſcipline by the firſt Chriſtians, in imitation of the Jewes, for want of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian magiſtrate, and not upon any commiſſion granted to the miniſters of the Goſpell indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently from the magiſtrate, or grounded upon the power of the keyes &amp; of binding &amp; looſing: for it were a leſſe matter to diſcard and keep off the magiſtrate from concurring in acts of excluſion, if for the placing it in the miniſters the Scripture were not ſo groſſely abuſed, and made to ſpeak what it never intended, and that which hath as much ſtrength for upholding the Romiſh hierarchie, as the presbyterian eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>Before therefore we come to ſpeak how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, from a law of the confederate diſcipline, became to be the main engine to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the myſtery of iniquity, we will examine all the places of the new Teſtament uſually al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the advocates of the presbyterian ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, to prove that excommunication is a law of Chriſt and a church-ordinance, as well as the preaching of the word and the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Sacraments, which are a like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the miniſters of the Goſpell only.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That the whole context Matth. 18. v. 15, 16, 17, and 18. maketh nothing for excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication; neither Iudas non-admiſſion (if granted) to the Euchariſt, nor the deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the inceſtuous perſon to Satan, nor yet the ſelf-examination required 1 Cor. 11.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe firſt place is taken from the context in Matthew 18. v. 15, 16, 17, 18. a place clear enough, had it not been handled by men of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced judgements. I wil not looſe ſo much paper &amp; time, as Mr. Rutherfurd &amp; Gilleſpie have done to make it difficult, nor throw ſo much duſt in the eyes of the readers, nor repeat all I have ſaid upon this ſubject in another book. I will chiefly reſtrain my ſelf to Calvins authority, to evince that the whole context maketh nothing at all for ſuch an excommunication, as is a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall act pronounced independently from the Chriſtian magiſtrate by the miniſters of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Calvin, in the fourth book of his inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions chap. 12. §. 3. and more expreſſely in an Epiſtle to the <hi>Neocomenſes,</hi> ſaith, that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence Matth. 18, 15. <hi>If thy brother,</hi> &amp;c. ought to be underſtood of private offences, and known
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:123664:183"/> only to the party offending and offended. Theſe be his words: <hi>We underſtand the words of Chriſt of concealed offences, as the words ſound: therefore if thy brother hath treſpaſſed againſt thee, and it be known to thy ſelf only, and there be no witneſſe, Chriſt commandeth that thou ſhouldſt repair to him privately.</hi> And a little lower; <hi>here it is not meant that hidden ſins ſhould be brought to light, thereby to ſhame our brother.</hi> So that this offence not breaking forth into an open ſcandall, it is not like that the wronged party would have taken a way to put his brother to an open ſhame, or that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt had wiſhed him ſo to do: but rather to make firſt one or two privy to it, and then ſome more truſty ſecret friends, it may be a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of three, called a church amongſt the Jewes, appointed to reconcile diſterences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween brother and brother, which were like the <hi>Morum Cenſores,</hi> cenſors of manners; or it may be ſuch as are mentioned 1 Cor. chap. 6. who were like the elders ſpoken of by Ambroſe, which were not inveſted with any authority to conſtrain, cenſure or puniſh the offender: for the words in the 17. verſe, <hi>let him be to thee,</hi> ſhew both that the offence was private, &amp; that the offended party was not to take any other courſe, but only to have no further converſe with him. For if he offender had been excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by a publick judgement, he had been a publican and a heathen, not only to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:123664:184"/> party, but to all others. But Jeſus Chriſt ſeemeth to a private offence and a private way of proceeding to give a private counſell, how the party wronged ought to behave himſelf to wards the offender.</p>
               <p>Learned Mr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> thinketh that in all the context there is nothing intended either of Jewiſh or Chriſtian excommunication; that there was no judiciall ſentence pronounced, nor conſtraint put upon the offending party, but only ſhame; and that not publick, but only within the walls of the ſynagogue or of the ſchool. As if a man would not provide for his family, after a firſt and ſecond admonition he was put to ſhame in the ſynagogue by theſe or like words, <hi>Such a one is cruell, and will not nouriſh his children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This makes way to know both what power that church in the Text had, and what is meant by it. Calvin upon the place hath ſome remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable conceſſions much to our purpoſe. 1. That Jeſus Chriſt alluded to the cuſtom of the Jewes, and had reſpect to the form of diſcipline among them. 2. That the power of excommunication belonged to the elders of the people, who repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the church. Which conceſſions are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing arguments to prove, 1. that Ieſus Chriſt by the word <hi>Church</hi> did not mean an aſſembly of men whoſe power was diſtinct from that of the magiſtrate; ſince no ſuch thing as was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Church, Kahal, Gnedah,</hi> in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:123664:184"/> was ever taken for an aſſembly of church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, inveſted with juriſdiction and diſtinct from thoſe of the Commonwealth. 2. Since the elders of the Iewes were no more elders of the church then of the Commonwealth, and that they had the ſole power of excommunicating, it followeth that the act of excommunicating was not more an act of church then of ſtate: and therefore if Chriſt ſpeaking of the Chriſtian ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, alluded and had a regard to the cuſtome of the Iewes, that likewiſe their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication muſt be like that of the Iewes, and be as well an act of magiſtracy as an act of the church. Which is confirmed by what he faith upon the 18. verſe, ſpeaking of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the church, where he makes two kinds of elders in the Chriſtian church anſwerable to two kinds of elders in the Iewiſh church. Now as theſe were not inveſted with a power called eccleſiaſticall diſtinct from the civil, ſo may we conclude of the elders in the Chriſtian church. Theſe be his words: <hi>Legitimam Eccleſiae gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernationem presbyteris injunctam fulſſe, non tantum verbi miniſtris, ſed qui ex plebe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum cenſores illis adjunctierant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But above all he is expreſſe upon the 17. verſe, where he ſaith that the Lord Ieſus Chriſt in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delling the churches diſcipline, ſendeth them to the inſtitution under the law: <hi>admonuit in ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia ſua tenendum eſſe ordinem qui pridem ſub lege ſancta institutus fuerat.</hi> If we all ſtand
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:123664:185"/> to Calvin, the quarrell is ended; and the <hi>church</hi> Matth. 18. will prove ſuch a church as was in Moſes, Ioſhua, and Davids time: by which is never meant a congregation of Prieſts or church-elders diſtinct from the commonwealths elders.</p>
               <p>So then we ſee, even according to Calvin, if Ieſus Chriſt ſpoke in the context of a church Chriſtian (as I do not believe he did) it muſt be a church of the ſame nature with the Iewiſh; in which excommunication being an act of magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy, ſo muſt it alſo be in the Chriſtian church. But I do not believe that in this whole context there is any thing meant either of the Iewes or Chriſtians excommunication, or of ſuch a church as our oppoſites would have to be underſtood by the word <hi>church, viz.</hi> an eccleſiaſticall ſenat or presbytery; being certain that neither in the old nor in the new Teſtament the word <hi>church,</hi> in Greek or Hebrew, is taken in that ſenſe. Is it likely that Ieſus Chriſt would mention a church that was never recorded in all the old Teſtament, and whereof neither the Evangeliſts nor the Apoſtles ſpeak?</p>
               <p>Doubtleſſe Chriſt ſpeaketh here of ſuch a church or aſſembly of men, who were, as Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin ſaith, <hi>Morum Cenſores,</hi> cenſors of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, much uſed among the Iewes and Romans; not inveſted with any judiciall power, but yet of ſuch authority and gravity, that whoever did reject their wholeſome advice and counſell,
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:123664:185"/> was as much diſcredited, as if he had ſuffered corporall puniſhment. It may be thoſe cenſors of manners were rectors and teachers of ſchools; men who for their gravity and learning were highly eſteemed among the people: and ſuch a ſchool ſome ſay Chriſt and his Apoſtles made up, much like thoſe ſchools of the Prophets in uſe in Samuels time, in which the ſcholars or young Prophets did ſit at the feet of the Rabbies, as Mary at the feet of Ieſus, who for that was called Rabbi-However thoſe words, <hi>if he neglect to hear the church,</hi> do argue that the church ſpoken of in this context was not inveſted with a power of cenſuring the offender, as Bilſon and Sutliffe do judiciouſly conclude from the words. For thus ſpeaketh Dr. Sutliffe in his 9. chapter <hi>de presbyterio; Chriſt ſpeaketh of a church that had no power to conſtrain, and which one might deſpiſe without insurring pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: for if it had had power to conſtrain, in vain had he added, if he will not hear the church, for the church would have conſtrained him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſhort, theſe words, <hi>tell it unto the church,</hi> are made, like <hi>regula Lesbia,</hi> a noſe of wax by Papiſts, Epiſcopall men and presbyterians: it is to them a wood, which if a thouſand men go into, none will fail to ſhape himſelf a ſtick, a mallet, or a hammer. Bellarmin will tell us, that <hi>tell it unto the church</hi> ſignifieth, tell it unto the Romiſh church, or tell it the Pope. Mr. Gilleſpie
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:123664:186"/> will expound it, tell it unto the presbytery. Dr. Hammond, tell it to the Biſhops, called by Chryſoſtome <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>I will not urge much the words, <hi>let him be to thee an heat hen or a publican,</hi> which if they do not make void excommunication, I am ſure they do not help it much; ſeeing that neither a publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can nor a heathen were the object or ſubject of excommunication. I conceive that the true pataphraſe of theſe words may be this, and that this was the meaning of the Lord Jeſus: If the offender refuſech all honeſt wayes to right thee, then proſecute him in the court of the magiſtrate, where heathens and publicans have their own judges: deal with thy brother as if he were (and as thou wouldſt do with) an heathen or a publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can: for ſince thou muſt now repute thy brother (as to thee) as an heathen or a publican, and ſince thou wouldſt not ſcruple to implead an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then or a publican, ſo neither muſt thou ſcruple to ſue thy brother. For ſure neither Jeſus Chriſt in this place, nor St. Paul in the 1 Cor. ch. 6. for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth Saints to go to law againſt an heathen before an heathen magiſtrate. Since then an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcilable brother ought to be eſteemed as an heathen, is it any whit againſt Chriſtian cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for the party offended to ſue him before an heathen magiſtrate? This expoſition is very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, having nothing ſtrained, but moſt like to be the ſenſe of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>As for the 18. verſe, concerning binding and
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:123664:186"/> looſing, we have examined what ſtrength can be in it for excommunication: not diſcuſſing whether it may not be as well applyed, as Chryſoſtome, Auſtin, Theophy lact thought, to every private man, as to the operation of the word in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry; or whether this verſe hath any coherence with the precedent diſcourſe of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Neither will I enter into the controverſy, whether Iudas was partaker of the Euchariſt, for it is not much materiall to know it; all agreeing he was not removed by any excommunication or caſting out, and that he did eat of the paſſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which eating was equivalent to that of the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>Now, leſt more heads of objection of this Hydra of excommunication ſhould ariſe, if all ſhould not be cut off, we muſt examine what ſtrength the example of the inceſtuous perſon 1 Cor. 5. hath for excommunication. But this extract being already too much lengthened, and the drift of it all along being, to prove that the caſting out of any member of a church, being the ſame with the putting out of the ſynagogue, is no act of miniſtry or of church members as ſuch, but an act of magiſtracy, I need not to ſpeak of it at all: beſides that theſe 3. or 4. ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations will take off all hold for excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication. 1. It is granted by Calvin, Beza, Walaeus, Apollonius, Mr. Rutherfurd and Mr. Gilleſpie, that St. Paul mentioneth but one cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure inflicted upon the inceſtuous perſon, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:123664:187"/> excommunication, and that the delivering of him to Satan was the caſting him out of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. 2. Now it being evident that this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering to Satan was no excommunication, but a judgement quite of another nature; it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe equally evident that the putting away of the inceſtuous perſon, being the ſame with delivering him to Satan, was no excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication. 3. This caſting out of the ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous perſon makes nothing for that excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication which is only a putting a man by from partaking of the Euchariſt: for though examples may be brought out of the Scriptures, of men caſt out or kept from the temple or ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, yet there is no one example, nor any reaſon for it, that a man admitted to enter either into the temple or the ſynagogue, ſhould not be partaker of the ſame myſtery or ordinances celebrated with the reſt. 4. Calvin thinks that St. Paul by theſe words, <hi>put away the wicked from among you,</hi> did not point particularly at the inceſtuous perſon, but rather at the devil or the wicked one indefinitely, as the plotter and contriver of all evil, which St. Paul ſaith was put away from them by that delivery of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous perſon to Satan. 5. Wendelinus in his common places of excommunication ſaith, that the putting away of the inceſtuous perſon from among the Cormthians, was not only an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from godly converſe, as praying, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and receiving the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uchariſt with him; but
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:123664:187"/> alſo from civil commerce, in eating, trading and talking with him. Which expoſition is the moſt naturall I know, and proveth that this put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away was no act of eccleſiaſticall power diſtinct from the civil: for alwayes every court puniſheth according to its kind: a court of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer doth not ſummon men for cauſes that are of the cognizance of a court-Martiall; ſo neither ſhould an eccleſiaſticall court impoſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties that are to be inflicted by a civil court, ſuch as is the depriving of a man of civil liberty. 6. Learned Mr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> ſaith, that all the power of the church of Corinth in delivering the inceſtuous perſon to Satan was, by the ſtrength of Paul's ſpirit that went along with them; ſo that the people of Corinth acting by no power of their own, no church ought to do as that church then did, except they be ſure of the aſſiſtance of the ſame ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Next in order followeth the neceſſity of ſelf-examination, 1 Cor. 11. made an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove that miniſters muſt examine every communicant, and judge of mens worthineſſe. For Beza, Walaeus, Mr. Rutherfurd and Mr. Gilleſpie thus argue: <hi>If it be the duty of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man to examine himſelf, much more is it the duty of a minister to examine him.</hi> Never was an argument more inconſequent, and leſſe concludent, by which the Papiſts may as well prove auricular confeſſion: <hi>If men muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe their ſins to God, much more muſt mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:123664:188"/> require every man to confeſſe their ſins to them.</hi> For (quite on the contrary) from this Text theſe or the like inferences ſhould be drawn: If all men muſt examine themſelves, much more ought miniſters to examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: or this; If every church-member ought to examine himſelf, then ought the miniſters to exhort them to that ſelf-examination: or this; If every church-member ought to prepare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the word and Sacraments, then miniſters are not to prepare them otherwiſe, then by ſhewing them and giving them directions for their due preparation, leaving every one to do the work himſelf.</p>

                  </gap>ſitive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt, by a juriſdiction independent from the magiſtrate, and by warrant from thoſe words, <hi>whatſoever ye ſhall bind on carth,</hi> &amp;c. I
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:123664:188"/> conceive to be abſurd, impertinent, &amp; a yoke laid upon Chriſtians necks which is none of Chriſts; as if whomſoever paſtors do bind or excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate on earth, Chriſt alſo doth bind or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate in Heaven, and whomſoever they abſolve or looſe on earth, Chriſt alſo doth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve and looſe in Heaven.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Since the words Matth. 16. and 18. be the very ſame words, it is abſurd to underſtand them in the 16. chapter abſolutely, but in the 18. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally. Now they would have the words Matth. 16. <hi>whatſoever ye ſhall bind,</hi> &amp;c. ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to Peter, to be without condition and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, that God ſhould approve of and ratify whatever opening, looſing and binding ſhould enſue upon Peters preaching and converting of ſouls; for Calvin, Pareus, and moſt Divines will not have in that place any thing underſtood of church-cenſures, but only of the operation of the word by the preaching of Peter. But though it were granted that in the 18. chapter Chriſt ſpake of church cenſures by excommunication, what reaſon is there why they ſhould not be underſtood as abſolute and without condition in one chapter, as well as in the other? For in the 18. chapter they put a condition to the abſolute words of Chriſt, ſaying that all that is bound on earth by excommunication is not alwaies ratified and approved of in Heaven: for were not, as they ſay, a modification put to the words of Chriſt, all the judgements and ſentences
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:123664:189"/> on earth had need be infallible. It is true, that parallel places of Scripture may admit various ſenſes, as it may be theſe very words of Chriſt; or that ſomething more may be implyed in one place then in the other. But yet whether both places or either of them be meant of the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word, or of the miraculous power granted unto the Apoſtles, and particularly, as Mr. Lightfoot expoundeth them, of a power to diſpenſe with the Chriſtian church in ſomething that was to be retained or quitted of the Moſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call laws and rites; yet it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that both places are alike to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood abſolutely and without condition, that whatever ſhould be bound or looſed by them on earth, ſhould alſo infallibly be either bound or looſed in Heaven. For to underſtand one place abſolutely, and the other conditionally, and <hi>clave non errante,</hi> when no errour can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene, I conceive ought not to be admitted in Divinity. In ſhort, either the words Matth. 16. abſolutely ſpoken muſt be falſe, and admit ſome exception, (which cannot be ſaid without blaſphemy;) or the ſame words repeated in the 18. chapter muſt not be underſtood of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, nor of any church-cenſure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Since it is evident that the keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven, and the power of binding and looſing, are equivalent expreſſions, and thoſe both equally committed to miniſters; if by the keyes are not meant the power of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:123664:189"/> &amp; abſolving, neither can the power of binding and looſing mean excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For ſure theſe keyes cannot be underſtood of an outward admiſſion or excluſion, but only of the converſion of a ſinner by the preaching of the word. But ſuppoſe that theſe keyes were alſo to admit into the viſible church, yet they can not be employed to put out of the church; a key being an inſtrument either to let in or keep out, but not to expell thoſe that are in.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Who can conceive that thoſe words Matth. 18. <hi>whatſoever ye ſhall bind,</hi> &amp;c. being uttered by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt with ſuch a prefatory aſſeveration, <hi>verily I ſay unto you,</hi> ſhould not be true without a condition and an exception put to them, and yet that the ſame words Matth. 16. without ſuch a preface ſhould be perpetually &amp; abſolutely true? And who would believe that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt had pronounced in ſuch an emphaticall way, <hi>vertily I ſay unto you, whatſoever ye ſhall bind,</hi> &amp;c. only to ſignify an externall admiſſion or excluſion; in the doing of which acts, miniſters may erre out of ignorance either of right or of fact, if not out of hatred, or too much indulgence and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Since they ſay that a man by excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is delivered to Satan; what an unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table act do they commit againſt any one, be he never ſo wicked, by putting him into ſuch a condition, as they know is worſe then his
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:123664:190"/> former, when they are not ſure whether occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally it may better him; neither is it in their power to drive away Satan again from the man, as it was in St. Paul? Beſides, no man would puniſh a child, a ſervant, or a malefactour, with a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ſhall laſt to his lifes end, as to torture him till death, or to whip him as long as he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, or put him in a priſon that may prove per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall: for ſtill the earthly father or judge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth to himſelf the liberty to give over cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting when it pleaſeth him. But thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver a man to Satan by excommunication, do inflict a penalty which it is not in their power to take off again, being not able when they liſt to recover a man out of the Devils pawes.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Moſt ſchool-men and Divines hold, that the ſentence of excommunication is of a quite different nature from the lawes and ſentences of men, which have the force and validity of law, be they never ſo unjuſt, and muſt be obeyed either actively or paſſively: for if no law were valid but that which is juſt and righteous, then ſhould no law be obeyed by any but thoſe that could ſee equity and juſtice in it. Which ſheweth the nullity of excommunication: for whoſoever doubts whether ſuch an excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was pronounced upon right grounds and good information, or whether excommunication in it ſelf is lawfull, may well count the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication null and of no weight: yea if the party excommunicated doth but ſay that he was
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:123664:190"/> wrongfully excommunicated, and <hi>clave erran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi> or that thoſe that did it had no power ſo to do, he may diſannull, as to himſelf, and ſo to all others, the excommunication. For as long as the knowledge of a valid excommunication is grounded upon matter of fact, which is known but to few, moſt men may ſtill queſtion that which they are not concerned to believe, and whereof they have no certain knowledge.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Some to avoid that inconvenience, that God ſhould be made to ratify what the paſtor acts in excommunicating, ſay, and it is the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Beza, that excommunication is rather a declaration of what God hath already done in Heaven, then an act preceding Gods, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving or diſapproving the miniſters ſentence. But one and the ſame inconvenience followeth thereupon, whether excommunication be taken for an act preceding the act of God, or ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to it. For if excommunication be a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of what God hath already done, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to be done; it would follow, that all the acts of paſtors in excommunicating were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible: for if they were fallible, it were not poſſible to know when excommunication ought to be received for a valid act, untill the mind and counſell of God were revealed, and it were known to be agreeable with the cenſure of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication. And therefore Wicliff thought all excommunications void and null, except he that excommunicateth were firſt informed that
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:123664:191"/> the party whom he was to excommunicate was excommunicated by God; and this was held one of his errours in the councill of Conſtance <hi>Art.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Calvin in the 3. book of his Inſtitutions chap. 4. § 14. ſaith, that excommunication is no farther valid, then as binding in heaven an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth to that on earth: for he hath no ſtronger argument to make void the Romiſh excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, then by retorting, that <hi>many among them are either bound or looſed on earth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, which notwithstanding are not bound or looſed in Heaven.</hi> If this exception againſt all Romiſh excommunication is good in Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins mouth, why ſhould it looſe its ſtrength in my mouth? for by the ſame argument I diſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null all excommunication, becauſe all ſentences of God in Heaven do not alwayes correſpond to thoſe that are pronounced upon earth.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The ſame Calvin upon Matth. 18. plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the nullity of Romiſh excommunication, uſeth this argument; that the power of the keyes and of binding &amp; looſing belong only to thoſe that have received the holy Ghoſt. Which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed overthroweth all kind of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for if the validity of an outward act de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth upon the inward grace, the validity of the act will be uncertain till doomſ-day, to thoſe that know not whether he that hath pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the ſentence of excommunication is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with the holy Ghoſt or no. Perkins
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:123664:191"/> goeth along with Calvin, upon the third of the Revelation, making all excommunication void which is not pronounced by one that hath the ſpirit: <hi>For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to the ſociety only of the regenerate and faithfull is it ſaid, What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ye ſhall bind,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But were it ſo, that every paſtor excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating had received the holy Ghoſt, yet the validity of all excommunication could not be thence inferred, ſince even a man endowed with the holy Ghoſt, except he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a ſpirit of divination, may be ill inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and erre ignorantly, <hi>ignorantia facti aut juris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Thoſe that by binding and looſing in Heaven underſtand only approving of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence paſt on earth, have no ſtronger plea for excommunication, except all ſentences of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication be the product of an infallible judgement: for God is ſo far from approving of an unjuſt ſentence, that his will is that it ſhould be diſannulled.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But how can it conſiſt with reaſon, that God at once ſhould ratify, approve, and diſlike a ſentence pronounced on earth? for they will have him to ratify in Heaven an unjuſt ſentence paſſed on earth, becauſe, they ſay, his will is that the party ſhould ſtand to the ſentence though unjuſt, and not intrude to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without he be legally abſolved; and yet the while they ſay that God doth not ratify or
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:123664:192"/> approve of an unjuſt excommunication, becauſe unjuſt; ſo that at once the ſame ſentence will be valid and invalid: valid, becauſe legally paſſed; yet invalid, becauſe unjuſt.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Thoſe that by binding and looſing under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand pardoning and retaining ſins, though they ſpeak truth, making the place Matth. 18. v. 18. parallel to that of John 20. v. 22. <hi>whatſoever ſins,</hi> &amp;c. yet they ſay nothing for excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, which is neither pardoning nor retaining of ſins. It is not pardoning, for then excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication muſt be counted a bleſſing: neither can it be retaining of ſins; for ſince, as they ſay, the end of excommunication is, that the ſoul may be ſaved, retaining of ſins, or rather of pardon, cannot be a means to that end.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Since excommunication is a putting out of the communion, I would fain know whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that outing is from the communion of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate church, or from the communion of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick viſible church, or elſe from the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Saints, which is ſpoken of in the Creed; for I know but of theſe three communions. If it be only a putting out of the communion of a private church, then a man excommunicated in one congregation or pariſh, is not excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in the neighbour church. If it be a putting out of the catholick viſible church, then a man excommunicated in London ſhall be likewiſe excommunicated in any part of the world. And if the vertue of excommunication extendeth all
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:123664:192"/> over the world (as indeed ſo it muſt be, ſince it reacheth to heaven) then any church or paſtors of that communion whatſoever may excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate any one within that communion, and a presbytery in Scotland may excommunicate a man in Switzerland: and therefore it muſt not ſeem ſtrange, that the Pope doth excommunicate Emperours and Kings, ſince they are of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Excommunication cannot be a putting out of the communion of Saints and of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible church; of which none is outed but by his falling from grace.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Neither can excommunication be a put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of a presbyterian church, nor out of ſuch an hierarchie as was lately in England, which are but meer politick ſyſtems of many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſocieties, either under the magiſtrate of the land, or under a power of magiſtracy aſſumed by common conſent, as is the body of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed churches in France: for then ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication were rather like a baniſhment or deprivement of liberty, then a ſpirituall cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which are no more bounded and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the limits of the magiſtrate, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion or retention of ſins, or the vertue of baptiſme, are.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Neither can it be proved that thoſe words, <hi>whatſoever ye ſhall bind,</hi> &amp;c. are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of excluſion rather from the Euchariſt then from the aſſembly, or from either; and that
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:123664:193"/> there is greater danger of corrupting good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in receiving the Euchariſt with a diſſolute man, then in converſing with him: when as quite contrary, to eat with carnall and deboiſt perſons is a more contagious commerce, then to partake of the Euchariſt with them.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Neither can they infer out of that Text, <hi>whatſoever,</hi> &amp;c. or any other, whether a church, a ſynod, a presbytery, whether one miniſter or two, may excommunicate. But if the power of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating be included within the power of the keyes, and of binding &amp; looſing, which we have made good to belong only to the diſpenſers of the word, and not to church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers or to lay-elders; it will neceſſarily follow, that one ſingle paſtor, ſet over four or five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand communicants, muſt have power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate alone, without the aſſiſtance of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miniſters: for every ſingle miniſter having received entirely the povver of the keyes, and of binding and looſing, muſt needs alſo have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ability to do vvhatſoever is included vvithin that povver.</p>
               <p n="18">18. It is to be noted, that Chriſt doth not ſpeak of binding and looſing of men, but of things; for he doth not ſay, <hi>whomſoever,</hi> but <hi>whatſoever:</hi> and therefore our adverſaries the Papiſts extend the povver of excommunication further then the presbyterians do, for they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate not only men, but any other living creatures, as Mice, vvhereof Thuanus hath a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table example.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That excommunication was mainly ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to the working of the myſtery of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. That the corrupting of the doctrine of the Euchariſt made way for excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Should next ſhew that excommunication was mainly ſubſervient to the working of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of iniquity; but this I have handled at large in my <hi>Paraeneſis.</hi> St. Paul ſaith, that in his time the myſtery of iniquity began to work. Satan was then very buſy to infuſe bad principles, which firſt put forth themſelves in the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of primacy, and in the corruption of the doctrine of the Euchariſt. The laity had no hand in it: for as Miniſters have alwayes been the principall chanels to conveigh know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and grace, when aſſiſted by the ſpirit of God; ſo when God gave them over to the guidance of their own ſpirits, they have been ſtill the only agents and inſtruments to bring in ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and hereſy into the church. The cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption then beginning at the head, &amp; amongſt the leaders of flocks, their main care hath been to ſet up themſelves not only over the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Lord, but alſo over their own fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-labourers and collegues: for the attaining of which, and to ſeem great in the eyes of all
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:123664:194"/> men, they turned the Euchariſt into an idoll, and this into a ſacrifice, hoping that theſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries taking once Gods place, the paſtors would be ſoon reſpected with a veneration beyond and above that which is due to magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates; having with the dignity of their functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a ſpeciall priviledge and power to diſtribute thoſe myſteries, particularly the Euchariſt, to ſuch as they ſhould count worthy; from whence came excommunication.</p>
               <p>But before excommunication could come to be the ſtandard of an eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction diſtinct from that of the magiſtrate, the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Euchariſt muſt precede: which was a work of many hundred years.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Fathers, though they had no inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of contributing to the working of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of iniquity, have occaſionally given a riſe to it: for either becauſe they lived among the Jewes and heathens, or becauſe they newly came from amongſt thoſe, who thought there could be no religion without ſacrifices and altars, condeſcending to the capacity &amp; weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe both of Jewes and Gentils, they borrowed many rites and ceremonies from them, yea their very diſcipline; they called the Euchariſt by the name of ſacrifice, and gave the name of altar to the communion-table, to the bread, the name of the body of Jeſus Chriſt, and to the wine, the name of his blood. All which made way for Tranſubſtantiation; which hath taken
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:123664:194"/> ſo deep root, that the very reformers, amongſt the reſt Luther, thought it too great a leap to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede too far from Tranſubſtantiation, but ſtuck in the mid-way, and kept to Conſubſtantiation: yea the beſt of ours, though they took away both Tranſubſtantiation and Conſubſtantiation, and have allowed no reall preſence of Chriſt but in the believer, yet, to the diſlike of ſome of their brethren, they have retained the very out-ſide &amp; phraſes which clothed Tranſubſtantiation, borrowed from the 6. chapter of St. John, of eating the fleſh of Chriſt and drinking of his blood, and feeding on the ſubſtance of his body; which expreſſions Bullinger wholly diſallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, as he openly profeſſeth in an Epiſtle to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za, and finds fault, that in a ſynod at Rochell, where Beza was preſident, in the year 1571. a canon was made, which condemned all ſuch as would not grant that the faithfull in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt were fed with the ſubſtance of the body of Chriſt: all which we are beholden for to the Fathers. Tertullian <hi>lib. de oratione cap.</hi> 6. ſaith, that the body of Chriſt is in the bread. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe upon the 17. of St. Luke, beſides the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that ſuffered, ſaith that there is alſo a body whereof it is ſaid, <hi>my fleſh is meat indeed.</hi> The Fathers uſually make three bodies of Chriſt; a body naturall, myſticall and Sacramentall: yea Juſtin Martyr and Hilary make a myſticall u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the divinity of Chriſt with the bread in the Sacrament.</p>
               <pb n="340" facs="tcp:123664:195"/>
               <p n="2">2. Next came the crying up of the vertue of the Euchariſt, near upon to as great an height as that of baptiſme. Thus St. Auſtin, the beſt of the Fathers, thought the Euchariſt was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to children for their ſalvation: which when they had made more myſterious then ever the holy Ghoſt intended, they deviſed ſeverall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of penance; 1. of hearers or catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meni, 2. then of competents, 3. of penitents, and laſtly of faithfull men and Chriſtians; thus making themſelves judges and arbiters of ranks and places that men ought to hold in the church: all which brought along with them excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, which from a law of confederate diſcipline, anſwerable to that practiſed among the Jewes, grew to ſuch ripeneſſe as to paſſe for a law of Chriſt, for a ſpirituall ſword, an arrow to be kept in the quiver of the church, and to be ſhot at the will and pleaſure of the miniſters. This is the weapon that hath proved ſo effectuall in the hands of the Pope, that with it and by it he hath built up his myſtery of iniquity, and founded an empire within the empire of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, Kings and States. By the ſame wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the great church-judicatory in Scotland keepeth all inferiour judicatories and churches in awe and ſubjection: for were this taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from them, or were the people well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the fond and panick dread they have of it, then they would upon more rationall grounds be ſubject to order and diſcipline.</p>
               <pb n="341" facs="tcp:123664:195"/>
               <p>But whatever height the power of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication aroſe to, it could never yet be had, but one of theſe two things ever attended the poſſeſſion of it: for either the Pope had it by a power of magiſtracy of his own, by which he kept all magiſtrates in awe; or it was alwayes diſputed and controlled by the magiſtrate of the place, where the Popes agents did endeavour to exerciſe their juriſdiction. This may be proved by the practiſe of all ſtates within the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Rome, ſpecially of France, where the Popes Bulls of excommunication have been often diſannulled and evacuated by acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and inferiour judicatories, yea by ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods convocated by the King. I will produce but one example, which I have read in an old French Hiſtorie, of the life of Lewis the ninth, written by Ionville above 400. years agone, cap. 82. where when a Prelat did deſire of the King the help of the ſecular power, for making his excommunications good, the King anſwered, <hi>that with all his heart he would do it; but that firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="342" facs="tcp:123664:196"/> obedience, but were to judge of them, and ſo ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to confirm them or abrogate them; for ſo did the Emperours, (before the Popes grew up to their height) from Conſtantine the great to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian, and did regulate, order, and diſannull or make void excommunications.</p>

               <p>We read indeed that Luther did commend it to other churches, and even at the conference or reconciliation that was made betwixt Luther, Bucer and Capito, he did much urge how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary the uſe of excommunication might be; and that Bucer declining to deliver his opinion concerning the ſame, leſt he ſhould croſſe Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and thereby retard the main work that they were met about, did only ſay, 1. <hi>that many cities, in lieu of excommunication, had ſtrict lawes to puniſh thoſe that were unruly and wicked:</hi> 2. <hi>that he profeſſeth in the name of his collegues of the churches of Switzerland, that they did not intend to give the Euchariſt to thoſe whom they ſhould know to be wicked, and to live in impenitency.</hi> Bucer in that did

For ſo ſayes Gualterus in his Homilies upon the 1 Cor. 5. <hi>The lawes of our city puniſh by excommunication thoſe that are negligent in hearing of the word, or in coming to the Lords Supper, and thoſe beſides that by their wicked lives offend the church: ſuch they expell from their tribes, lest they ſhould keep company with others.

Matthaeus Flaccius Illyricus did yet with more eagerneſſe endeavour to eſtabliſh excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, and for that was perpetually at diſcord with Melanchthon, who did not ſo much diſlike the retaining of the Romiſh excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, as the introducing of a new one: for Melanchthon was ſuch a lover of peace, that he would willingly have endured the Romiſh Biſhops ſhould have kept their juriſdiction ſtill, ſo that they had parted with other abuſes and practiſes.</p>
               <p>I could make a volume if I ſhould rehearſe all the journeys and removes that Illyricus made from place to place, urging every where the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of receiving excommunication: and for that very reaſon was he alwayes expell'd, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Prince or the magiſtrate of the place, who lookt upon Illyricus as a man aiming at ſetting himſelf up, under a ſpecious pretence of ſetting up the government of Chriſt, and one who continually jingled the keyes not of Gods, but of his own Kingdom, which he endeavoured to ſet up whereſoever he ſet footing. At length, partly by his much clamouring (being a very eloquent and learned man) and the workings of his emiſſaries, partly for the reſpect that moſt men bore to the memory of Luther, who firſt went about the ſame buſineſs, there was a kind
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:123664:198"/> of excommunication received in many Lutheran churches, agreeable, as they thought, to the mind of Luther, as he propounded it to them, and as he ſpeaketh in his comment upon Joel ch. 4. where he maketh two ſorts of excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the one internall, when God excludeth men from the aſſembly of the faithfull; the other externall and politick, like an act of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy placed in the whole body of the church, and not in the miniſters: and from that excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication they do not forbid appeals; neither do they ground it upon the words of Chriſt, <hi>whatſoever ye ſhall bind,</hi> &amp;c. as Chemnitius and Gerhardus, the beſt expoſitors of Luthers mind, tell us.</p>
               <p>But excommunication had not the ſame en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment in Switzerland, where Zwinglius begun the reformation, almoſt as ſoon as Luther did in high Germany. For Bullinger, in an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to Dathenus, relates, that in a conference that Zwinglius had with an Anabaptiſt in the year 1531. this was his opinion concerning excommunication; That becauſe churches under a heathen magiſtrate had no coercive power to puniſh wickedneſſe, they in lieu of it took up excommunication: but once having a Chriſtian magiſtrate, who puniſheth and reſtraineth vices and enormities, the uſe of excommunication ceaſeth. In the ſame Epiſtle Bullinger ſaith, <hi>a church may be true that wanteth this excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication:</hi> again, <hi>we maintain that there
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:123664:198"/> ought to be a diſcipline in the church; but it is enough if it be adminiſtred by the magiſtrate.</hi> Beza acknowledgeth that this was alſo the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Muſculus, as we have alledged before, when he ſaith that St. Paul would not have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered the inceſtuous perſon to Satan, if the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate at that time had been a Chriſtian, and a favourer of churches. Gualterus, as we have ſaid but now, was of the ſame mind with his father in law Bullinger; for which Mr. Rutherfurd and Gilleſpie are very angry.</p>
               <p>So then excommunication, finding no good entertainment in Switzerland, is carried to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva by the great man Calvin, whom God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be deceived in that particular, leſt the reformed world ſhould have taken him for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible. There excommunication grew into a great tree, that ſpread its branches far &amp; near, into France, England, Scotland, the Palatinat, and the low-Countreys: but before it could ſhoot out, it had many rubbs and oppoſitions. For ſome years before Calvin was ſettled in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva, the reformation had been happily begun by Farell and Viret, and yet no excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was thought on or practiſed. At the firſt propoſall he made of it, many of the town flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Syndics and the other magiſtrates, as he confeſſeth in an Epiſtle to Myconius, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching them not to part with the power and ſword which God had committed to them, leſt it ſhould cauſe ſeditions: and indeed they proved
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:123664:199"/> true Prophets, as we ſhall ſee by and by. Beza in the life of Calvin, in the year 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>t the Popiſh tyranny was recalled. But all theſe difficulties</hi> (ſaith Beza) <hi>Calvin ſurmounted; yet he did not cenſure other churches as unchriſtian, that had not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo far, nor thoſe pastors who did not conceive their flocks needed to be restrained by ſuch a bit or bridle.</hi> And indeed Calvin himſelf, though very eager to bring in excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, inſomuch that ſometimes he calls it the yoke of Chriſt, &amp; the diſcipline of Chriſt, &amp; profeſſeth to be ready to endure either death or baniſhment, rather then to ſuffer that the towns ſenat ſhould take upon them the right of excommunicating, as he ſaith in an Epiſtle to Viret; yet he cannot but ſpeak very reſpectfully of his neighbour mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, who acknowledged no ſuch neceſſity upon excommunication, as that it ſhould be accounted amongſt the ordinances of Chriſt. Theſe be his words, in an Epiſtle to the paſtors of Zurich, in the year 1553. <hi>All men are not of the ſame opinion concerning excommunication: neither am I ignorant that there be many godly and learned men, who think not excommunication neceſſary under Chriſtian Princes.</hi> I ſhould not care much to erre in that point of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:123664:199"/> with Bullinger and Muſculus, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition that I were as godly and learned as they.</p>
               <p>But however the opinions of the neighbour churches and miniſters about excommunication ſtood, Calvins great authority prevailed to ſet up excommunication. In an Epiſtle to a perſon not named, pag. 409. and 410. in folio, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth at large which way he went about it; and there he hath theſe words, which carry as much authority, as if his will had been a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient rule for Geneva, and ſo for other churches to be governed by: <hi>Volui, ut aequum eſt, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualem poteſtatem à civili judicio diſtingui; ita in uſum rediit excommunicatio: It was my will that, as it is fitting, the ſpirituall power ſhould be diſtinguiſhed from the civil judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ſo excommunication came again to be in uſe.</hi> But however his will was, he was never able to make good his eccleſiaſticall or ſpirituall juriſdiction diſtinct and independent from that of the magiſtrate.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the ſame ſpirituall ſenat was made and conſtituted by the ſenat of the town, as Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin acknowledgeth in an Epiſtle to Bullinger in the year 1553. and therefore it was ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the juriſdiction of the civil magiſtrate, not only in its firſt making, but alſo all the time after: juſt as when Conſtantine the great inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted <hi>for a Epiſcopalia,</hi> Biſhops courts, he looked upon them as depending on his juriſdiction, not
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:123664:200"/> only in their firſt conſtitution, but alſo in their duration, in the reviewing, and ratifying their lawes and ſentences, or diſannulling them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is true, Beza ſaith in the life of Calvin <hi>an.</hi> 1541. that at the firſt conſtitution of that eccleſiaſticall ſenat and its lawes by the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and the people, there was a ſoveraign law made, that no ſort of men, miniſters, magiſtrates or people, ſhould hereafter preſume and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to diſannull what therein was eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the law-makers of Geneva. This indeed would have been a very fooliſh &amp; abſurd law, like that of Clodius, whereof Cicero ſpeaketh, that could not be repealed or abrogated either by the ſenat or people; for when ever the law is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated, that clauſe alſo <hi>that the law cannot be abrogated</hi> is likewiſe abrogated. Who would think that either the magiſtrate and people of Geneva ſhould ſo enſlave themſelves, and tye their hands, as not to be able to repeal, review or reforme lawes formerly made by them; or that they ſhould believe their lawes were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and given by them with ſuch an unerring judgement, that they needed no further recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p n="3">3. This juriſdiction, called by Calvin eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall, could not be exerciſed and managed without a coercive reſtraining power, or a power of magiſtracy, either ſeated in the miniſters and conſiſtory, or delegated from the magiſtrate. For among the lawes of diſcipline of Geneva this is
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:123664:200"/> one, <hi>If any one, in contempt of the eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſentence or judgement, is ſo bold as to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to come to the Sacrament, let him be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled and driven back by the miniſter.</hi> Here then there is a power of magiſtracy, or a coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive power aſſumed by the miniſters, without which he confeſſeth that all eccleſiaſticall cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are null and of no effect. So in an Epiſtle to Viret <hi>an.</hi> 1547. ſpeaking of a woman with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the conſiſtory who declined the presbyteriall court and judgement, and beſides did tire them out with her too much prating, <hi>ſhe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>would have overwhelmed us with her thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering language, if ſhe had not been put out by force.</hi> I ask here, by what power was this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man thruſt out? was it eccleſiaſticall and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and a power of binding and looſing, or a civil coercive power? and of the two keyes they ſay they have, which of them was taken in hand, and by which end of the key was the woman driven out?</p>
               <p n="4">4. But the nullity of that ſpirituall juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is evidently demonſtrated, by the perpetuall conflict and claſhing, in Calvins time, betwixt the ſentences and judgements of the conſiſtory of Geneva and thoſe of the magiſtrate, whereof I have given many examples out the life and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles of Calvin. Among others of one Barto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, who being excommunicated by the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, did appeal from that ſentence to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, who once did confirm the judgement
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:123664:201"/> of the conſiſtory, and another time did evacuate and diſannull it. Whereupon there being a great conteſt betwixt the magiſtrate and the conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to whom the judgement and right of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating did belong, Calvin with much ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe obtained, that ere any thing were concluded, the opinion of four cities of the Switzers ſhould be deſired. Bullinger maketh mention only of one city, namely Zurich, in an Epiſtle of the Senat of Geneva to that of Zurich; wherein among other quere's this was one, <hi>Whether there is no other way to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate a man, but by the conſiſtory?</hi> In that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle Bullinger, though very fearfull to offend Calvin, yet manifeſtly ſheweth his diſlike of the whole buſineſſe, and exhorteth him to modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and mildneſſe. Whatever was the iſſue of the conteſt, we do not read that the magiſtrate of Geneva did ever repeal this decree of the court, <hi>that the laſt judgement about excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication falls under the cognizance of the Senat of Geneva.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>THe reformed churches of France took their pattern of diſcipline, and therewithall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, rather from Geneva then from the Proteſtant Cantons: for being to live under a croſs magiſtrate, they could not exerciſe their diſcipline as a law commanded by the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, nor execute their cenſures of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication as acts of the magiſtrate: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reformed churches of France have upon much better grounds retained excommunication, then the churches of Geneva, who living under a magiſtrate that was himſelf part of the church, were not neceſſitated to divide juriſdictions; ſince the ſame men who were members of churches, were alſo members of the city and magiſtracy: and ſince the diſcipline, yea ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:123664:202"/> was a law of the magiſtrate, there was little need to divide powers and juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions; which when they ſhould have done all they could, muſt needs ſtream from the ſame ſpring-head. But in France they could not be ſo happy; and therefore ſince they could not have a juriſdiction immediatly derived from their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, it was requiſite they ſhould take up one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uall conſent, and by a confederate diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. For when the magiſtrate (as it was among the Jewes in their captivity) is no countenancer of the true religion, nor a keeper of the two ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, nor a nurſing father of the churches that live under him; they muſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, if they can obtain his leave, be a magiſtrate and a law unto themſelves, and ſet up a kind of magiſtracy by mutuall conſent, not only in their private churches, but alſo in their conſiſtories and ſynods, by which religion and piety may be aſſerted, and errours in liſe and doctrine be reſtrained. So that when a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate church excludeth a man either out of its communion, or aſſembly, this it doth by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther power, then a magiſtrate, a town, a co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or a hall ſhould act by, in baniſhing or expelling a member of their own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe few of the miniſters in France will acknowledge that their diſcipline is taken up upon ſuch grounds, but rather that it is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the pattern in the mount, and the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of Chriſt; as if it were a ſpirituall cenſure,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:123664:202"/> and a ſword committed only to the miniſters by a Scripture warrant, and from the power of the keyes, and of binding and looſing.</p>
               <p>But I much wonder that wiſe men, having a good foundation upon which they may firmly ground their diſcipline, ſhould rather chuſe to build it upon the ſand and upon the ſea ſhore, where it may be ſoon waſht away. What man, poſſeſſing an inheritance by a good title, would renounce that, and rather feign a falſe will and teſtament, and upon that ground his title, which proving invalid will put him by the inheritance he had a good title to? Yet this they do, who will acknowledge no diſcipline but from Chriſt, and will not put a man out of their aſſemblies but by a power derived to them from Chriſt. But it being proved to their faces, 1. that Jeſus Chriſt never chalked out any form of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, but left it to the prudence and diſcretion of Chriſtian magiſtrates, paſtors and people, who in generall are commanded to ſee that all things be done orderly, 2. that excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is no otherwiſe a law of Chriſt, then is the act of putting away a hurtfull member from any ſociety; theſe two things, I ſay, being made out to them to be Scriptu e, reaſon and common ſenſe, and yet they perſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſting to have no other grounds for their diſcipline, then thoſe feigned ones, who ſeeth not that their diſcipline muſt be groundleſſe, ſince they caſt away that which might ſtrongly ſupport it? Thus they are like a
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:123664:203"/> man that cuts off his good leggs, and buyes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wooden crutches to walk upon.</p>
               <p>This is that doctrine that my Paraeneſis was ſo much blamed for by my countrey-men, yea neareſt kindred, as if I went about to take away all diſcipline, and to bring in ſtead of it diſorder and confuſion; yea further, to lay the reformed churches open to the perſecution of their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries. But my conſcience tells me, I never had any ſuch deſigne; and my reaſon prompts me, that no ſuch thing can be concluded from what I have written of that ſubject. For it is with the diſcipline of the reformed churches in France un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their magiſtrate, as it was with that of the Jewes under the Babylonians, Perſians and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans: for whereas before their captivity they had no diſtinction betwixt church and ſtate, no other diſcipline then the law of the land, no ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction diſtinct from that of their magiſtrate; afterwards, when they lived under magiſtrates who were no friends to their lawes and religion, they were fain, as far as they were permitted, to ſet up a diſcipline by conſent, which was in lieu of the magiſtrate, whereof one law was to be caſting out of the ſynagogue, which we may call excommunication. So that their juriſdiction was no otherwiſe diſtinct from that of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, then as the power of a ſon, in ordering his own affairs and religion contrary to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt commands of his father, is diſtinct from the paternall power. When a man cannot go to the
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:123664:203"/> charge of lead, he muſt thatch his houſe with ſtraw; if he wants means to keep a ſervant, he muſt ſerve himſelf; and if he wants one to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern him, he muſt be his own governour: and yet that power whereby he governeth himſelf, and is maſter of his own actions, is not diſtinct from that which a governour was to have over him.</p>
               <p>The very ſame thing the reformed churches in France may ſay, who make uſe of what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy they can contrive and ſet up among themſelves, in lieu of their own magiſtrate, who cares not for their religion. If they be perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, while they hold that their diſcipline is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up by conſent, as the Jewes was under ſtrange magiſtrates; I do not ſee how they will be leſſe expoſed to perſecution, when ever they hold that their diſcipline is not of mans devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, but of Chriſts own appointment. For the magiſtrate doth not give them the liberty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> their diſcipline under any ſuch notion, either as it is confederate and arbitrary, or punctually ſet down in Scripture: for either way he counteth their diſcipline to be but a departing from the true church, and their reformation to be a meer deformation. So that it matters not much as to their ſafety, what foundation they make their diſcipline to ſtand upon.</p>
               <p>Sure, it is not like, that thoſe that were the authors of the diſcipline of the reformed churches in France, did look upon it as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:123664:204"/> left by Chriſt to his churches, but rather as a collection of rules well digeſted by humane wiſedome and prudence, alterable according to time and place. For ſo much ſaith the laſt arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of their diſcipline: <hi>Theſe articles contained in this book concerning diſcipline, are not ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined and ratified amongst us, but that they may be altered as the emolument and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the church ſhall require.</hi>

               <p>I hope, when all prejudice ſhall be laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides no rationall man will deny my principles. I have alledged John Meſtrezat, a very learned man, late miniſter at Paris, both in my Parae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis and in my Corollarie, in a letter of his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten but a few weeks before he died; where his judgement is wholly conſonant to my opinion, <hi>that all church-government is prudentiall, arbitrary, and taken up by conſent, for neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of order, and not for conſcience.</hi> Beſides, I have the teſtimony of a very reverend preacher in a famous church in Normandy, in a letter of his to me, wherein after he hath delivered his own judgement concerning the book, he addeth that of one of his fellow-miniſters in that church, in theſe words: <hi>One of my collegues, who hath read your firſt book hath given this teſtimony of it, That he is much ſatisfied upon the reading of it; and that your opinion is ſo far from weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our diſcipline, that on the contrary it doth rather ſtreng then it, and places it upon its true and naturall bottom.</hi>

               <p>In ſhort, whereas our brethren the Scots held that all juriſdiction of eccleſiaſticall aſſemblies, ſynods and presbyteries, was derived from Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, the Engliſh people, at leaſt the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, who would never permit the eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call juriſdiction to get up, held no juriſdiction but ſuch as was derived from him: for even from King Edward the ſixths time, the ſoveraign Princes have been very ſhie of Biſhops keeping any courts or calling ſynods, but only in their name.</p>
               <p>Our brethren the Scots had their excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication from Geneva, as well as the reformed churches of France: only Andrew Melvin did mightily improve and heighten it. But they and the Geneva churches have this diſadvantage, which thoſe of France never had, that theſe have two pleas for their diſcipline and excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: The one is the neceſſity of a confederate diſcipline taken up by conſent under a croſs magiſtrate; by which plea they may juſtify all the acts of their juriſdiction: the other plea, if the firſt prove not ſtrong enough, they have in common with all other reformed churches li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving under an orthodox magiſtrate; and that plea is the diſcipline of Chriſt; which as it is a ſecond ſtring to the bow of the reformed churches of France, if the firſt ſhould break, ſo it is the only ſtring and hold that the Dutch,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:123664:205"/> Scotiſh, and Geneva churches muſt hold by: ſo that if they cannot make good their <hi>jus Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> of diſcipline and excommunication, they have no plea at all for their juriſdiction diſtinct from that of the magiſtrate, as the reformed churches of France have.</p>
               <p>This book would ſwell too much, if I ſhould make it good, as I have done in my <hi>Paraeneſis</hi> and <hi>Corollarium,</hi> that they have outgone all the reformed in the task of building an empire within the empire of another, or in the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſettle a juriſdiction diſtinct from that of the magiſtrate, having while they ſtrive to run furtheſt from Popery, gone ſo far about, that they have joined iſſue with Popery in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>
               <p>I find three main cauſes why in Scotland, more then in any other nation where religion was reformed from popery, the eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction hath higheſt lifted up its head.</p>
               <p>The firſt is; it was not ſo much any humour or deſigne of the godly people, as opportunity that brought it in. For reformation taking its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning there not at the head, but at the foot, and in oppoſition to a perſecuting magiſtrate, it was not poſſible to ſettle the pure worſhip of God, without a government and juriſdiction aſſumed within the juriſdiction (and diſtinct from that) of the magiſtrate. They having had it ſome time under a Romiſh magiſtrate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it was to continue in the like manner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:123664:206"/> a reformed magiſtrate; and ſo turned the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſity of a confederate diſcipline taken up by conſent, as it was by the faithfull people of Iuda under a heathen magiſtrate, and by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed churches of France under a Chriſtian, into a neceſſity of Divine ordinance: which being much countenanced by the great ones of the land, who reſcued the ſoveraign magiſtrate from the Popiſh party, and brought him up from his infancy in the reformed religion; the ſame men, who were aſſertors of the eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction againſt the magiſtrate when he was no friend of theirs, had a fair opportunity to keep it ſtill up, when the magiſtrate was their friend, and in their power and poſſeſſion; who when he was grown up to years, found the eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call juriſdiction too deep rooted for him to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and overbalancing the power that by right (as all other magiſtrates and Kings in the world) he was to have over all cauſes, matters and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. So that from that time when King Iames (in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>per years) came to underſtand that he was a King, and no King, till he came to be King of great Britain, we read of nothing but claſhings and conflicts betwixt church &amp; court, Parliament and eccleſiaſticall aſſembly: it being impoſſible that two coordinate juriſdictions, and of the ſame nature, could ſtand together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt one and the ſame people in the ſame countrey.</p>
               <p>Another cauſe is, that the members of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:123664:206"/> ſpecially the nobility and gentry, being alſo members of eccleſiaſticall judicatories, and the eccleſiaſticalls having over and above an addition of ſtrength by all the miniſters of the land, who were not members of Parliament, it could not otherwiſe fall out, but that the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction aſſumed in churches, presbyteries, ſynods, and aſſemblies, ſhould not only appear diſtinct from that of the magiſtrate, but alſo be raiſed to a greater height.</p>
               <p>A third reaſon is, that the Kings of Scotland having never had that majeſty, power, revenue and ſplendour that other Kings abroad had, and yet the land full of nobility and gentry, who had great juriſdictions, many vaſſals and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers, the greateſt part of which received no luſter or increaſe of dignity or wealth from their Prince; theſe had reaſon, in emulation or oppoſition to that ſmall number which the King favoured and protected, to join themſelves with the Kirk party, there to find what the court could not afford them.</p>
               <p>I have nothing to ſay concerning excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication in the Low-countries, but that they have no better plea for it then the churches of Scotland or Geneva.</p>
               <p>I ſhould now cloſe up the hiſtory of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, by relating how it ſped in the Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate; where I think it was received the laſt of any reformed church, though that place was one of the firſt that was reformed from Popery.
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:123664:207"/> This may be ſeen in an Epiſtle of Zanchius to Conradus Hubertus in the year 1568. where he relates, <hi>that for many years there was an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt made to bring in excommunication; which was withſtood by many, not ſo much that they had a diſlike of it, as that for ſome politick reaſons it was not judged yet ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to ſtir further in it: however, by the mention that was made of it, the ſpirits of men have been much alienated one from another.</hi> Then he tells us of one George Withers an Engliſh-man, who being to diſpute for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Doctor under Boquinus, among other poſitions had one touching the neceſſity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing excommunication; which was oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with much eagerneſſe, ſo far that one of his opponents, being ſtraitned for time, ſo that he could not alledge all that he had to ſay againſt excommunication, deſired another day of diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ation: which being granted, Zanchius ſaith, that the diſputation grew ſo hot, that <hi>one of the opponents, a Minister, proteſted openly againſt the falſity of the poſition, as contrary to the word of God.</hi> At which time Eraſtus, amongſt others, wrote againſt excommunication. It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that Zanchius did but favour under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand the advocates of excommunication; for he ſaith, <hi>for many honest reaſons I would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle, but keep ſilence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By what I have related of the practiſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication in ſeverall churches and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:123664:207"/> we may eaſily conceive and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend</p>
               <p n="1">1. That excommunication, when retained upon the account of confederate diſcipline, and as anſwering to the caſting out of the ſynagogue among the Jewes, may very well conſiſt with the peace, ſafety and integrity both of life and doctrine, in the churches of France, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, under a contrary magiſtrate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That excommunication retained by churches under a contrary magiſtrate, upon the plea of <hi>jus Divinum</hi> for their diſcipline and excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, may be exerciſed with as little outward diſturbance &amp; diſpute, as if they did retain it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the account of confederate diſcipline: but ſuch churches then will not only uſurp a power which hath no warrant from Chriſt, but beſides will enſlave mens conſciences, laying upon them a yoak which is none of Chriſts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But that excommunication, upon what plea ſoever retained by thoſe churches that live under an orthodox magiſtrate, is inconſiſtent both with the outward peace of the nation where they live, and the inward peace and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of mens minds.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That excommunication as it is retained by the reformed churches in France, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, under a magiſtrate differing from them, and upon what plea ſoever exerciſed, either of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate diſcipline, or as had by Divine right, is not attended with thoſe claſhings, diſputes

                  </gap>x magiſtrate, keeping with them the ſame uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of faith: &amp; that for theſe reaſons. 1. A church-member excommunicated in France will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly complain to the magiſtrate, for he would but ſlight his complaints, and make a mock of the man; and therefore the party excommunicated muſt needs ſit ſtill, and ſtand to the ſentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him: but a member of a church excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated in Geneva or Scotland, looking upon the magiſtrate as a friend to the religion he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th, and a defendour and protectour of his own church-diſcipline, will be ready, if he can make his cauſe probably good and plauſible, to ſue and ſeek for redreſſe. Hence we ſee there were more appeals in Calvins time from the church-judicatory to that of the magiſtrate in the little territory of Geneva, then are in a whole age through all the churches of France. 2. Church-members under a contrary magiſtrate will be more united in affections and minds, and ſo will keep cloſer to the obſervation of the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. 3. Under a contrary magiſtrate members are uſually ſuch as believe what they outwardly profeſſe, and not like thoſe under an orthodox magiſtrate, where there is more of outward conformity to the religion of the ſtate, which is no hinderance, but rather a furtherance to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ferments: and therefore where there is more evenneſſe, foundneſſe, ſincerity
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:123664:208"/> and zeal, there muſt be alſo a greater ſubmiſſion to the church-diſcipline, and leſſe claſhings ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the variety of diſpoſitions in the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. 4. There is a great neceſſity of exerciſing a juriſdiction among the reformed churches in France, for the compoſing of ſuch differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves as have relation to their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and religion, which otherwiſe being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to the popiſh magiſtrate, would but bring our religion into contempt and deriſion. But un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a magiſtrate that is a friend to religion theſe differences may be, with as little fear of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall and deriſion to the profeſſion and doctrine, made up and reconciled by men of his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and chuſing, as within a conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and as well and better by the conſiſtory, if delegated thereunto, and inveſted with authority from the magiſtrate, then any other way, ſo that there be but one juriſdiction. 5. As there was a great neceſſity of diſcipline among the Jewes living under an adverſe magiſtrate, which ſhould be in ſome ſort diſtinct from their juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; ſo was there leſſe need either to have it divided from that of the magiſtrate when he was a countenancer of their religion, or to have any at all more then the law of the land. The like may be ſaid of the Chriſtian churches.</p>
               <p>I will conclude this charter with two or three paſſages out of Andrew Rivet, my much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured Uncle when he lived, and whoſe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is of great weight with all the Divines of this
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:123664:209"/> land, namely the presbyterian miniſters, and which taken into conſideration, will be found to deliver as much as ever I have aſſerted, though none yet hath inveighed againſt him as an Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and an enemy to order and diſcipline.

               <p>The firſt kind of authorities is of thoſe that, for the main, concur with me, or rather I with them: ſuch are Zuinglius, Muſculus, Bullinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Gualterus, Meſtrezat, Mr. Jeremiah Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs, Mr. Lightfoot, &amp;c.</p>

For whoever admits (as moſt of theſe authors do) that the judgements of Paſtors in presbyteries &amp; ſynods are ſubordinate to that of the ſoveraign
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:123664:210"/> Chriſtian magiſtrate, and that appeals from church-judicatories to the magiſtrate are grounded upon Scripture, reaſon, and the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of all nations, and beſides ſaith, that the magiſtrate is the ſupreme governour and head of the church over all cauſes and perſons; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I ſay, grants theſe to be truths, muſt needs overthrow eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction and power of excommunication, except it be in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to (and dependently on) the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</p>
               <p>But among all the reformed Divines who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the throng of thoſe that hold an eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall juriſdiction, and a government diſtinct from that of the magiſtrate, none hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered poſitions in print ſo near the language of Mr. Coleman, as Ludovicus Cappellus, paſtor and Profeſſor at Saumur, yet living, hath done; which paſſing currant for truth from the mouth of Cappellus, if they had fallen from Mr. Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, would have been taken by our brethren the Scots for pernicious and dangerous tenets, and mere Eraſtianiſme.</p>
               <p>In the firſt part of his Theſes Salmurienſes, <hi>de poteſtate &amp; regimine Eccleſiae</hi> theſ. 12. he ſaith, that paſtors have properly no other juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, then that which ſubdueth the affections of the world and the fleſh, when the ſpirit of Chriſt in the word reſtraineth the aſſaults of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan; that there is no other authority of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the church, then what is ſeated in Chriſt the

               <p>In his third theſis he ſaith, that the power of excommunication does no more argue a juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over the flock, then preſcribing a diet to a patient argueth the phyſitians power, juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, command and dominion over the patient; making the juriſdiction in both alike in theſe reſpects. 1. As a phyſitian may ſuſpend his own act in adminiſtring phyſick; ſo the miniſter in giving the Euchariſt. 2.

               <p>In his diſputation <hi>de clericorum immunitate &amp; privilegiis</hi> theſis 10. he ſaith, that Princes have power to inflict puniſhment upon tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors of the lawes that concern the worſhip of God, the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and the doctrine of faith; and beſides, that theſe lawes have no force except they be confirmed and ratified by them.</p>
               <p>In his 12. theſis he ſaith, that the lawes about faith, the Sacraments, divine worſhip, diſcipline,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:123664:212"/> and eccleſiaſticall order, cannot be defined or decreed in a ſynod, nor any controverſies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in decided, without the knowledge and conſent of the magiſtrate, if he be godly and Chriſtian, as being the keeper of both tables; who ought to confirm and ratify the lawes agreed on, if they be juſt, elſe to amend and correct them, ſeeing he is the ſervant of God both for the ſpirituall and temporall good.

               <p>In his 13. theſ. he confirmeth the ſame by the example of the commonwealth of Iſrael, when
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:123664:213"/> the Kings, even againſt the will of the Prieſts, did ſet up and order the true worſhip of God. But in his 14. theſ. he would not have this ſo to be taken, as if the faithfull were to receive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees and orders, becauſe decreed or ordered by the councill or magiſtrate, in caſe they be not agreeable with the word; but only that nothing can be decreed, bearing the name and force of law, obliging and requiring externall obedience, without the conſent and the ſanction of the magiſtrate.</p>

Yet ſome of theſe later have given me a large teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, to have delivered nothing but truth; and acknowledged themſelves to be now convinced (which they were not before) that excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is meerly of mans deviſing, and not an ordinance of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>I could name many, but that ſome of them are like Joſeph of Arimathea, acknowledging fully that truth which we maintain, but ſecretly, for fear of their fellow-miniſters, that are ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:123664:213"/> poſſeſſed with prejudice againſt it. Others being like thoſe that have told a tale ſo long, that at length they believe either that it is truth, or at leaſt that there is ſome truth in it: for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, ſince Calvins time, every communion-day pronounced this clauſe in their Liturgy, <hi>I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate ſuch and ſuch ſinners in the name and authority of Chriſt;</hi> they are rather prone to believe there is ſome truth and ground for this commination, then to ſearch too far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: beſides, their collegues ſtrongly believing that excommunication is an ordinance of Chriſt, if they ſhould never ſo little queſtion it, they might be in danger of ſuſpenſion from their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and benefices.</p>
               <p>But all (God be thanked) are not afraid to countenance this truth; as will appear by the judgement which the rever. Miniſters of Diepe in France have given of my <hi>Paraeneſis</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollarium,</hi> here annexed, as related by one of them, whoſe gravity, piety and learning is ſo eminent, that he not only deſerves to be believed when he ſpeaketh in the name of himſelf and his brethren; but alſo were it his own ſingle teſtimony, it might wel over-balance hundreds of thoſe that diſſent from him, but have not pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated to the bottom of the controverſy, as he hath done.</p>
               <p>The Gentleman being unknown to me, but by report, I ſent him my <hi>Paraeneſis,</hi> and deſired him not to ſpare me, in delivering his cenſure

                        <hi>I Have read Mr. du Moulins book through, and am much ſatisfied by reading of it. He is a man of great reading, of excellent reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a ſolid judgement.

I was glad to know that the differences between the Presbyterians and thoſe they call Independents were not about points of faith; and this joy of mine was more encreaſed, when I ſaw that the ſaid Independents do not (as they were falſly charged to do) reject ſynodall aſſemblies, yea that they are ſo far from reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, that, on the contrary, they hold them to be of Divine institution, acknowledging that they are conſtituted to give good and wholſome advice for the making of lawes.

                     <p>
                        <hi>I Have received in due time the letter and book which you have honoured me with. I have read both the one and the other with ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; both becauſe they give me freſh aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of your affection, and chiefly for that they ſtrengthen in me the perſwaſion that the reading of your firſt book had very deeply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in my ſpirit. Your poſitions ſeem ſo well grounded, and back't with ſo many au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities of the contrary opinion, that except you can be convinced of falſhood in the citation of the ſaid authors, I do not ſee how your ſaid poſitions can be overthrown. Therefore, for the love I bear to truth when it is made known to nee, I will adhere faſt to that which you have, as I think, ſo clearly demonſtrated unto me, till a greater light cauſeth me to ſee that I am gone aſtray in following your steps: and I will not only carefully entertain that truth my ſelf, but alſo ſtrive to impart it to others, that they being well acquainted with the matter treated of in your books, may have more chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table thoughts of you then thoſe have, who go about to make you a profeſt enemy to the holy miniſtery and the diſcipline. One of my Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legues, who hath read your firſt book, hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged unto me, he is much ſatisfied by
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:123664:218"/> the reading thereof, and told me, that your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is ſo far from pulling down or ſhaking the ſtability of our diſcipline, that quite contrary, it is clear to him, that it builds it up firmly and ſtrenghthens it, laying it upon its naturall and true foundations. Another of my Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legues hath not indeed ſo openly declared to me, that he found himſelf overcome by the ſtrength of your reaſons; but yet he hath been brought ſo far, as to doubt and make a question of what heretofore he held to be indubitable. Mr. Lagnel, the fourth of my Collegues, a perſon endowed with a moſt ſolid judgement, upon the deſcription I made him of the nature of the controverſy between the Independents and the Presbyterians, and of the reaſons you bring in the behalf of the opinion of the first, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judgeth the victory unto them. And I doubt not but that thoſe who ſhall read your writings, laying aſide all prejudice, and weighing, as they ought, your reaſons, will give glory to God, and entertain ſo clear a truth, which rendreth to the magiſtrate and to the church what belongeth unto them, and plucketh up by the root the remnants of Papall tyranny, which have been retained ſtill in the exerciſe of ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall diſcipline, ſpecially among the Scots; of whom you give us a notable example, which ought to make the hearts of all good men start and tremble. So then, although your book hath ſuffered in its birth thoſe contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:123664:219"/> which uſually are incident to them that fetch out a truth from the tombe, yet you have reaſon to hope, that the truth delivered in it will render it victorious, and make you ſee by experience that, <hi>tandem bona cauſa triumphat.</hi> Now when I anſwered your first letter, I thought I was not to write to you, but only of the principall ſubject of your book, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking of the additions; for I had well o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I had alſo taken notice of the digreſſion you make in your Preface a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Mr. Daillé, and Amyraldus; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I did then write to Mr. Congnard my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion thereof, and that I could have wiſhed for many reaſons that you had not meddled with them: but what is written is written; which I hope will not hinder, but that thoſe that follow their opinion concerning the univerſality of grace, as conceiving it to be grounded upon Scripture and upon the authority of moſt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, both ancient and modern, and chiefly of our firſt reformers, will embrace, if they be good men, the truth which you preſent unto
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:123664:219"/> them, ſo that they may perceive it without any kind of prejudice. I pray God they may do it. I am ſorry I delayed this anſwer ſo long but, beſides that I am entangled with a law ſuite, which a naughty man hath troubled me with, I had a great deſire that my Collegues ſhould firſt have your book communicated to them, that I might tell you their opinion, what they think of it.

               <p n="1">1. That all private churches are independent from any church-judicatory, and that what power ſo ever is given, or promiſe made to a church, ought not to be aſcribed to the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, nationall or presbyter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
